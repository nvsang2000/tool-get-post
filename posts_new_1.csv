<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As a life-long Lakers fan, I by no means support the Philadelphia 76ers (although I am an Eagles fan. Go Birds!), but I have always admired the phrase “trust the process,” a phrase coined by former 76ers GM Sam Hinkie. Hinkie’s phrase emphasizes putting faith into a strategic plan for achieving success. Like respect, faith and trust are not given to someone you don’t know. Faith and trust are important aspects to any relationship and must be developed with a combination of time and integrity. The more a relationship has of these, the better it is. Let us not forget Hinkie’s objective: success (more on this later).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">AUHS BSN students are tested; by the time they reach AUHS’ final nursing course, BSN students would have endured a program that possesses a range of 28-53 courses, labs, and clinical rotations combined—not to mention all within 3 years. All of the late nights spent studying, all of the assignments that needed attention, all of the classes that needed to be attended, all of the 12-hour clinical rotations, and all the exams that must be passed—all of these experiences prepare and lead our students to their final nursing course N460: Transition to Professional Practice.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">N460 is a course designed to challenge our students’ knowledge, and their ability to apply that knowledge through examinations, with one end goal: pass the NCLEX. N460 is a course of examinations, in fact the course contains a minimum of 26 examinations, 16 of which must be passed with a minimum score of 80%. Going through a course with 26 exams crammed into a quarter (of 10 weeks) can be a humbling experience, another humbling aspect is that it is extremely rare for a student to pass each of these exams with the required benchmark on their first attempt. It is a humbling experience when you’re told you’re not good enough; but it is this humility that is needed to be successful, to become an even better version of yourself.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">N460 has existed for a number of years and has gone through some minor changes, but the rationale behind the course has remained the same. As I’ve mentioned in a previous article regarding this topic, we always look to improve the course to be a better resource for our students. Our students are provided with great resources in terms of preparation, but I genuinely believe the key to this new-found success is building strong relationships with them.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It may sound far-fetched, but building a strong relationship with our students is key in terms of their NCLEX success. During senior orientation, and all throughout the final quarter of BSN, we preach to our students the importance of 1) Putting 1000% effort in going above and beyond, 2) Sacrificing their social life, and 3) taking the NCLEX within three weeks of course completion. We require them to complete a minimum of 50 NCLEX-style questions and rationales per day, every day for over 10 weeks, (that is on top of the course requirements, live reviews, optional review sessions and the aforementioned 26 exams). </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">It is a lot to ask</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> and a lot to require.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The students may be so confident in their abilities and accomplishments that they may decide not to study, or even not to take the course too seriously. In my experience the more you know someone, the more you can understand them, and the more you understand them, the more you can trust them, and the more you can trust them, the more you’re willing to listen to their advice (and vice versa). Over the past two cohorts of graduates (Cohort 29 and Cohort 30 – which are both included in our 2023-2024 pass rates), 81% of the students attempted the NCLEX within a month of graduating (most within three weeks), and 100% of those students who did so passed the NCLEX on their first attempt – remember this is something we drill into our students, and something we’ve found as not a practice from cohorts. Additionally, our pass rate between those two cohorts is currently 94%!&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">We are not looking to reinvent the wheel—we have a “process.” It is strategic, and it is proven. We simply need our students to “trust the process;” we must pull the absolute best out of our students, and we need them to realize that for themselves too! They have made it this far, they possess the knowledge, and experience to be successful, but they too must bring out their best and trust the process—this all happens through strong relationships.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As I noted in ‘Around AUHS’ my colleagues have prevailed upon me to say a few words about myself. I am a California native and an only child. My father is a retired jail chaplain, and my mother is with the Lord. At an early age, I learned that I was a sinner and needed a savior. This was brought home to me when one of my friends convinced me to steal some money from the offering when I was about four or five.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

I read many different books as a child, but one in particular made an impact on me (besides the Bible, of course): </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Voice Under Every Palm</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">. It is the history of radio station ELWA and after I read it, I believed God was calling me to be a missionary, specifically to work in a missionary radio station like ELWA. To that end, I studied electronics in high school and worked in the school radio station. However, in my senior year, my counselor advised me to think about something in English. You see, I had just gotten the highest verbal score on the SAT in the high school while my mathematics score was merely respectable.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">To make a long story short, I eventually got an MA in Applied Linguistics, married a beautiful young lady from Taiwan who also had a call to missions and went to Central Asia as missionary for 23 years where I taught English and worked on translation. We also had three children who are now grown up and five grandchildren.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">I came to AUHS to teach English as a Second Language because of the opportunity to bring Christian values into the curriculum. Since then, I have become part of the campus ministry and part of the planning for a new university focused on training people to minister to the homeless.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In the future, after getting the new university off to a good start, I plan to travel with my wife and spend more time with our grandchildren.&nbsp; So, now you know a bit more about me. I am thankful for the opportunities to impact the lives of students and build a better world to the glory of God.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There are many references to labor in the Bible, and with Labor Day coming up, it seems an appropriate topic.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Our upcoming holiday, Labor Day, is often seen as the unofficial end of summer.  This holiday provides us a moment to pause and reflect on the balance between work, education, and future aspirations. For many, this day off is a welcome respite from the hustle of the academic year, but it also offers an opportunity to consider the broader implications of labor and what it means to enter the workforce. As you prepare for your future careers, it’s important to recognize the labor that has paved the way for the opportunities you have today. We encourage you to take a moment to pause, reflect, and appreciate the intersection of education and work, and to consider how you can contribute to the workforce in ways that are meaningful and fulfilling.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The Olympic games 2024 in Paris, France have shown a lot of new achievements and records. They are the results of consistent and focused training based on a well-structured long-term plan composed from progressive overload and adequate rest and recovery. Good sleep habits are essential for developing physical and mental toughness, resilience and focus not only for the elite athletes but everyone who wants to maintain overall health and well-being.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The nickname “Sleeping Beauty” given to Yaroslava, is a playful reference to the classic fairy tale “Sleeping Beauty,” but in this case, it’s a sign of her ability to rest and recharge in a short amount of time, even during intense athletic competition. It’s a clever and fitting nickname that has stuck with her!</span><br>
<span data-contrast=""auto"">Yaroslava Mahuchikh is a Ukrainian high jumper, 22 years old who is prominent in the athletic world with her impressive performances in the last years: World Champion (2022), European Champion (2022), World Indoor Champion (2022) and unique approach to competition despite of full-scale wartime in her Homeland country. Her will to win was based on her love for Ukraine and dedication to memorialize 500 sportsmen and coaches who died during the two and half years of wartime.&nbsp; Mahuchikh has openly discussed her reliance on sleep to compensate for her intense training and competition schedule. She believes that sleep is essential for her mental focus on specific goal, her body’s recovery and repair. During competitions, she often brings a sleeping bag with her and takes short naps between jumps.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Establishing healthy sleep habits is key to long-term health and vitality, especially in the modern time when asynchrony between the biological clock and the social clock creates deficiency of nighttime sleep in different age groups [2, 3].&nbsp; Effects of sleep debt could mimic attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which could be present not only in childhood but also in adulthood.&nbsp; Insufficient sleep or bad quality of sleep has become widespread recently and can contribute to the development of cardiovascular, endocrine, mental diseases as well as cognitive dysfunction and cancer [4, 5, 6]. Thus, it is important to have daytime sleeping—napping [7].&nbsp; There are different types of napping based on duration, functional significance, and their impact on memory and mental health [Tab.1]. The introduction of National Napping Day in 1999 by a Boston University professor, William Anthony Ph.D., and his wife, Camille Anthony, has spread awareness on the importance of getting enough sleep and its benefits via different types of sleeping.  Here are 5 tips on how to have effective sleeping habits.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Different types of sleeping, such as napping, mini-sleeping, and others, offer various benefits for enhancement cognitive productivity, emotions, sleep onset and prevent physical or mental existence. There are several options for daytime sleeping which could be beneficial for you too and your personal wellbeing that will help you to the right way to re-load yourself:</span><br>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By John Schloss, Ph.D.</strong><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When I first heard about the controversy surrounding the 2024 women’s Olympic boxing contender, Algeria’s Imane Khelif, involving her Y chromosome, I assumed her karyotype was an example of Klinefelter’s syndrome.&nbsp; During 1968 women’s Olympics, Barr body detection was introduced as a verification method for female gender.&nbsp; Someone with an XXY karyotype would meet the 1968 criteria for female gender.&nbsp; Any individual with two X chromosomes has a dark spot, easily determined under a light microscope, in the nucleus of each cell.&nbsp; This dark, heterochromatic spot is one of the two X chromosomes that are randomly inactivated in each cell with the 47,XXY genetic makeup.&nbsp; Barr bodies </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">are a convenient marker for females (46, XX) or individuals with Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Imane Khelif qualified for the women’s Olympics because she was born anatomically female.&nbsp; Does this mean she is not genetically 47,XXY?&nbsp; There are examples of individuals with the XXY karyotype and a female phenotype.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>3-5</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> In one example, the individual had the normal determinants of male sexuality on the Y chromosome (</span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">SRY</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> and </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">ZFY</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">) and normal SRY-box-related genes on autosomal chromosomes (e.g., </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">SOX9</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> on chromosome 17).</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>5</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> This phenotypically normal female was not a mosaic, where some cells have the normal female karyotype (e.g., 46,XX/47,XXY or 46,XX/47,XXY/48,XXYY).</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>5</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> So, it is possible for an individual to be anatomically female at birth; possess a 47,XXY karyotype; have Barr bodies in the nuclei of all cells; and have the </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">SRY</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> locus on the Y chromosome, meeting all criteria for participation in the 1991-1999 women’s Olympics, despite possessing a Klinefelter’s karyotype. Based on her birth certificate, Imane Khelif was born female.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Imane Khelif could be born female, even if she had the typical male karyotype, 46XY.&nbsp; The only difference would be the absence of a Barr body in each cell’s nucleus. There are three recognized disorders that can result in an anatomical female with an XY karyotype:&nbsp; (1) complete gonadal dysgenesis also known as SWYER syndrome; (2) Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) from deficit of the 17-α hydroxylase/17–20 lyase enzyme; and (3) Congenital Androgenic Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>6</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> The frequency of these disorders is quite low ranging from one per 10-16 thousand births for CAH,</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>7</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> to one per 20-60 thousand births for CAIS,</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>5</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> to one per 80 thousand births for SWYER.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>6</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">Summary:</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp; Based on information available in the popular press, it is not possible to tell whether the karyotype of Imane Khelif includes 47,XXY, 46,XY, or some other combination of X and Y chromosomes.&nbsp; A cursory review of the peer-reviewed scientific literature suggests that it does not matter which combination of X and Y chromosomes an individual inherits, since they can still present as an anatomically correct female at birth and develop as such, unaware of their Y chromosome.&nbsp; One difference between 47,XXY and 46,XY females will be the absence of Barr bodies in the nucleus of cells derived from the latter.&nbsp; To present as an anatomically correct male at birth and develop as such, requires the </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">SRY</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> gene on the Y chromosome and other genetic elements, some of which are on somatic chromosomes and not present on either the X or Y chromosome.&nbsp; Migration of the </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">SRY</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> gene to other chromosomes (e.g., by X/Y terminal exchange during meiosis) will also allow for birth of a karyotypical female (46,XX) that presents as an anatomically correct male (Chapelle Syndrome first described in 1964).</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>8</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> It is not possible from someone’s anatomy to determine their makeup with respect to X and Y chromosomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

My amazing advisor at the time, Miss Jessica Ayala, was really encouraging and helped guide me through the enrollment process which is another reason I chose AUHS.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I love spending time with my family and going shopping. Nursing school is tough and time-consuming so [when there is] any chance I get to spend quality time with my loved ones, I am happy. I also try to volunteer for AUHS charity events.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I plan to graduate nursing school, become a registered nurse, and help my parents retire early because they have sacrificed everything for me to get where I am. I owe all of my success to my parents and to God. My dream job is to become a pediatric nurse, but I am also considering aesthetic nursing. However, I will be happy as a nurse as long as I get to help people.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Psalm 23 is a beautiful expression of the joy of having a good shepherd.&nbsp; A shepherd meets the needs of his sheep. What do sheep need—a lot of the same things we need: food, water, security, healthcare, and love.&nbsp; Look again at the familiar words:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There is a spiritual side to this provision as well. Philip Keller writes about the peaceful streams that “earth’s religions, pagan worship, and human philosophy is bound up with this insatiable thirst for God” (2015, p. 39). He goes on to discuss how the application of oil protects the sheep against parasitic flies which he likens to the irritations in our lives (Keller, 2015, p. 103). Yes, we have a shepherd he takes care of us so that we flourish!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One other thing, to get all these benefits the sheep need to follow the shepherd. We all need to follow the good shepherd to have everything that we need.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Arjun Dutta, PhD, Dean&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> The School of Pharmacy recently graduated its third cohort of students. Already, in its brief history, the school has contributed to the healthcare workforce of the country by educating and training the next generation of pharmacists. Our ethos lies in the simple facts,  inspire strong Christian values; practice evidence-based, patient-centered care; and foster a community of research and scholarship, so as to meet the healthcare needs of diverse patient populations. Following this armature, our students go out into the world with an aim to reduce healthcare disparities and render healthcare to the underprivileged and underserved and serve their communities.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

It truly “takes a village…,” as students need the support system outside of their professors and school system to graduate from a rigorous discipline as pharmacy. Three years of academic rigor, sleepless nights, and many an exam, the commencement is not only a culmination but a promise of realizing the fruits of their labor. As part of the commencement exercises, we celebrate the efforts of our graduates but at the same time they take the oath of the pharmacist, that reiterates to one and all, the promise of putting their education into practice for the welfare of the patients and serving the public.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commencement traces its roots back to medieval monastic rituals, where education was relegated to the clergy. The symbols and the pageantry have deep rooted meanings, that go back again to toil and hard work in pursuing one’s goals. At the end of the day, education, is a great equalizer and we celebrate it during commencement and welcome the new graduates to the fold by eliciting a promise to serve those who are entrusted to our care. The School of Pharmacy continues to build on its mission of education healthcare professionals committed to serving.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> A final word to our graduates, as their beaming faces traversed the stage, clutching their diplomas, the journey as a pharmacist has just begun. Miles to go, before we can rest and people to serve. Let’s hold on to our values, keep the faith, and practice this wonderful profession with utmost integrity and passion.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Known as the mother of modern nursing, Florence was awarded the Red Cross of St. George in the 1860s for her tireless work during the Crimean War. In a gesture of shared honor, Florence presented a medal of excellence to her brightest graduates. This act inspired the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas Hospital in London to design and award all nurses a badge with a Maltese Cross upon their program completion. By 1916, the practice of the pinning ceremony had become a standard across the United States and England. The badge symbolizes educated women competent to serve as nurses and provide society with healthcare. A faculty member followed the graduates onto the stage during the ceremony, where they were given the nursing pin. This is often an emotional portion of the ceremony for students and faculty, marking their transition from student nurses to registered nurses, symbolizing the support and guidance faculty have provided throughout the students’ journey. The faculty’s role in the students’ journey is crucial, and their support and guidance are deeply appreciated.  This act was followed by the Nightingale Pledge and a candle-lighting ceremony to commemorate Florence Nightingale’s use of candlelight to help wounded soldiers at night. At AUHS, this act was followed by the Blessing of the Hands, a symbolic representation of how the hands should be used to deliver care and compassion and bless all that nurses encounter.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commencement, in the context of nursing, typically refers to the ceremony held to celebrate and officially recognize the completion of a nursing program by its students. It is often called a graduation ceremony or gathering. During commencement, nursing students receive their diplomas or degrees, marking their transition from student nurses to registered nurses or advanced practice nurses. This transition is not just a milestone but a testament to the dedication and commitment of the new nurses to the nursing profession. It’s a significant milestone where graduates, their families, faculty, and often healthcare professionals come together to honor the new nurses’ achievements and unwavering commitment to the nursing profession, invoking a sense of pride and admiration in the audience.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As we recently celebrated the Fourth of July, I want to take a moment to reflect on two key principles that will shape your experience here at AUHS: freedom and responsibility.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">College is a time of unparalleled freedom. You have the opportunity to explore new ideas, pursue your passions, and make decisions that will influence your future. This freedom is exhilarating and empowering. It allows you to discover who you are, challenge yourself, and grow in ways you never imagined.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Your actions and decisions now carry weight and consequences. Embracing responsibility means understanding the impact of your choices on your academic success, personal well-being, and the community around you.  During your short time at AUHS, you have the opportunity to learn self-discipline, respect for others, accountability, and community engagement. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The freedom you enjoy as college students is a precious gift that comes with significant responsibility. Embrace both with enthusiasm and wisdom.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Drug discovery and drug development are essential to the creation of therapeutic solutions which all heath care professionals employ in the art of healing. These involve complex processes that begin with the discovery of the new drug molecule, its testing in cells and animals, and, finally, its trials in humans. Proving that the new drug molecule is both safe and effective for the indication requires extensive clinical trials in human subjects and patients. This endeavor is highly regulated by the government to ensure that all drugs approved are both safe and efficacious. While physician-investigators conduct the trials, clinical research professionals facilitate, oversee and manage them at the clinic or the institution.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In 2023, an article was published from AUHS concerning the effect that 22 different nutrients had on the risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID. After reading the article a dentist reached out to the author, Dr. John Schloss, for advice on dietary supplements.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">John, I read your research title “Nutritional deficiencies that may predispose to long COVID” and it gave me some interesting thoughts. As a dentist, I focus on the overall health of my patients every day, and the connection between oral health and nutrition is very close. If nutritional deficiencies can indeed affect our resistance to COVID, it has important implications for how we advise patients to adjust their diets and supplement with vitamins and minerals. What are your thoughts on this topic?</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Answer from Dr. John:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It is important to be comprehensive in your approach to supplements. There are macrosupplements that are important in addition to the microsupplements contained in the average multivitamin supplement. These include things like taurine, not usually included in most supplements, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">N</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">-acetylcysteine (better pharmacokinetics and fewer side effects than cysteine), beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, and essential amino acids. Getting the amounts right and not overdosing on those that can have toxic consequences (e.g., zinc and selenium) or are provided in an abnormal form with questionable pharmacology (e.g., cyanocobalamin for B12) can be difficult. There are some potential dietary supplements that are not currently commercially available or even on the nutritional supplement ‘radar’, like dolichol. Limiting total caloric intake has long been known to retard aging and extend lifespan but few know that this is, in part, due to a reduction in dietary methionine intake. Diet and dietary supplements are complex topics with a considerable amount of misinformation due to commercial interests from various directions. It is also a moving target because we really don’t know everything.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
