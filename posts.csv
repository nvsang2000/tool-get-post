<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>With Alek Haliliyan&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I was born and raised in Kuwait City, Kuwait, and moved to the U.S. when I was 12 years old.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">My parents have been married for 23 years and have worked really hard to provide my brother and I a comfortable life. My younger brother Avo is my only sibling, and he is my pride and joy. I am forever grateful to have an amazing family.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Both religions taught me how to be respectful; especially towards my elders; it helped shape my cultural values and I also learned right from wrong. My family in Kuwait also played a huge part because they taught me how to be caring and empathetic through difficult situations. I have learned that dark times are temporary and there is always light at the end of the tunnel.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I applied to AUHS in Spring of 2023 after I didn’t make it into an ADN program. I knew AUHS was the right school for me because when God closes one door, he will open another. My motivation to join AUHS was its Christian values and its accelerated BSN program. My amazing advisor at the time, Miss Jessica Ayala, was really encouraging and helped guide me through the enrollment process which is another reason I chose AUHS.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I love spending time with my family and going shopping. Nursing school is tough and time-consuming so [when there is] any chance I get to spend quality time with my loved ones, I am happy. I also try to volunteer for AUHS charity events.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I plan to graduate nursing school, become a registered nurse, and help my parents retire early because they have sacrificed everything for me to get where I am. I owe all of my success to my parents and to God. My dream job is to become a pediatric nurse, but I am also considering aesthetic nursing. However, I will be happy as a nurse as long as I get to help people.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Psalm 23 is a beautiful expression of the joy of having a good shepherd.&nbsp; A shepherd meets the needs of his sheep. What do sheep need—a lot of the same things we need: food, water, security, healthcare, and love.&nbsp; Look again at the familiar words:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There is a spiritual side to this provision as well. Philip Keller writes about the peaceful streams that “earth’s religions, pagan worship, and human philosophy is bound up with this insatiable thirst for God” (2015, p. 39). He goes on to discuss how the application of oil protects the sheep against parasitic flies which he likens to the irritations in our lives (Keller, 2015, p. 103). Yes, we have a shepherd he takes care of us so that we flourish!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One other thing, to get all these benefits the sheep need to follow the shepherd. We all need to follow the good shepherd to have everything that we need.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Arjun Dutta, PhD, Dean&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> The School of Pharmacy recently graduated its third cohort of students. Already, in its brief history, the school has contributed to the healthcare workforce of the country by educating and training the next generation of pharmacists. Our ethos lies in the simple facts,  inspire strong Christian values; practice evidence-based, patient-centered care; and foster a community of research and scholarship, so as to meet the healthcare needs of diverse patient populations. Following this armature, our students go out into the world with an aim to reduce healthcare disparities and render healthcare to the underprivileged and underserved and serve their communities.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

It truly “takes a village…,” as students need the support system outside of their professors and school system to graduate from a rigorous discipline as pharmacy. Three years of academic rigor, sleepless nights, and many an exam, the commencement is not only a culmination but a promise of realizing the fruits of their labor. As part of the commencement exercises, we celebrate the efforts of our graduates but at the same time they take the oath of the pharmacist, that reiterates to one and all, the promise of putting their education into practice for the welfare of the patients and serving the public.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commencement traces its roots back to medieval monastic rituals, where education was relegated to the clergy. The symbols and the pageantry have deep rooted meanings, that go back again to toil and hard work in pursuing one’s goals. At the end of the day, education, is a great equalizer and we celebrate it during commencement and welcome the new graduates to the fold by eliciting a promise to serve those who are entrusted to our care. The School of Pharmacy continues to build on its mission of education healthcare professionals committed to serving.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> A final word to our graduates, as their beaming faces traversed the stage, clutching their diplomas, the journey as a pharmacist has just begun. Miles to go, before we can rest and people to serve. Let’s hold on to our values, keep the faith, and practice this wonderful profession with utmost integrity and passion.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The American University of Health and Sciences School of Nursing (SON) marked two significant milestones on Friday, July 12, 2024: the Pinning Ceremony and Graduation of BSN degree candidates from the esteemed class of 2024. These events hold immense significance for our students, symbolizing their transition from student nurses to registered nurses, and for the nursing profession as a whole. The Pinning Ceremony and Graduation are not just formalities, but they are deeply rooted in the history and values of nursing, signifying the students’ readiness to serve and the profession’s recognition of their commitment.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Known as the mother of modern nursing, Florence was awarded the Red Cross of St. George in the 1860s for her tireless work during the Crimean War. In a gesture of shared honor, Florence presented a medal of excellence to her brightest graduates. This act inspired the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas Hospital in London to design and award all nurses a badge with a Maltese Cross upon their program completion. By 1916, the practice of the pinning ceremony had become a standard across the United States and England. The badge symbolizes educated women competent to serve as nurses and provide society with healthcare. A faculty member followed the graduates onto the stage during the ceremony, where they were given the nursing pin. This is often an emotional portion of the ceremony for students and faculty, marking their transition from student nurses to registered nurses, symbolizing the support and guidance faculty have provided throughout the students’ journey. The faculty’s role in the students’ journey is crucial, and their support and guidance are deeply appreciated.  This act was followed by the Nightingale Pledge and a candle-lighting ceremony to commemorate Florence Nightingale’s use of candlelight to help wounded soldiers at night. At AUHS, this act was followed by the Blessing of the Hands, a symbolic representation of how the hands should be used to deliver care and compassion and bless all that nurses encounter.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commencement, in the context of nursing, typically refers to the ceremony held to celebrate and officially recognize the completion of a nursing program by its students. It is often called a graduation ceremony or gathering. During commencement, nursing students receive their diplomas or degrees, marking their transition from student nurses to registered nurses or advanced practice nurses. This transition is not just a milestone but a testament to the dedication and commitment of the new nurses to the nursing profession. It’s a significant milestone where graduates, their families, faculty, and often healthcare professionals come together to honor the new nurses’ achievements and unwavering commitment to the nursing profession, invoking a sense of pride and admiration in the audience.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">We extend our heartfelt congratulations to our students for their remarkable achievements. As they embark on their journey to make a positive impact on the world, we offer our blessings and best wishes for their future endeavors.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Caroll Ryan, PhD&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As we recently celebrated the Fourth of July, I want to take a moment to reflect on two key principles that will shape your experience here at AUHS: freedom and responsibility.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">College is a time of unparalleled freedom. You have the opportunity to explore new ideas, pursue your passions, and make decisions that will influence your future. This freedom is exhilarating and empowering.

Your actions and decisions now carry weight and consequences. Embracing responsibility means understanding the impact of your choices on your academic success, personal well-being, and the community around you.  During your short time at AUHS, you have the opportunity to learn self-discipline, respect for others, accountability, and community engagement. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Drug discovery and drug development are essential to the creation of therapeutic solutions which all heath care professionals employ in the art of healing. These involve complex processes that begin with the discovery of the new drug molecule, its testing in cells and animals, and, finally, its trials in humans. Proving that the new drug molecule is both safe and effective for the indication requires extensive clinical trials in human subjects and patients. This endeavor is highly regulated by the government to ensure that all drugs approved are both safe and efficacious. While physician-investigators conduct the trials, clinical research professionals facilitate, oversee and manage them at the clinic or the institution.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">John, I read your research title “Nutritional deficiencies that may predispose to long COVID” and it gave me some interesting thoughts. As a dentist, I focus on the overall health of my patients every day, and the connection between oral health and nutrition is very close. If nutritional deficiencies can indeed affect our resistance to COVID, it has important implications for how we advise patients to adjust their diets and supplement with vitamins and minerals. What are your thoughts on this topic?</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Answer from Dr. John:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It is important to be comprehensive in your approach to supplements. There are macrosupplements that are important in addition to the microsupplements contained in the average multivitamin supplement. These include things like taurine, not usually included in most supplements, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">N</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">-acetylcysteine (better pharmacokinetics and fewer side effects than cysteine), beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, and essential amino acids. Getting the amounts right and not overdosing on those that can have toxic consequences (e.g., zinc and selenium) or are provided in an abnormal form with questionable pharmacology (e.g., cyanocobalamin for B12) can be difficult. There are some potential dietary supplements that are not currently commercially available or even on the nutritional supplement ‘radar’, like dolichol. Limiting total caloric intake has long been known to retard aging and extend lifespan but few know that this is, in part, due to a reduction in dietary methionine intake. Diet and dietary supplements are complex topics with a considerable amount of misinformation due to commercial interests from various directions. It is also a moving target because we really don’t know everything.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">How do we meet needs? First, you need to clearly identify the needs and then set a goal. Next, you need a plan to meet that goal. This is what we do every day at AUHS. Read on to learn more about meeting needs and meeting those who meet needs like our student, Louisse Castillo, and our nursing professor, Jeazale Julian!</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>Student Services: Salt and Light&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Brent Davis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><span data-contrast=""auto""><strong>Do you have a plan for meeting your needs? </strong>Whether they are plans for lunch or plans for retirement, I am sure you do. Ideally, we don’t want to just get by, we want to be successful, to exceed our needs (or expectations). When a company wants to provide a new product to meet a need, it goes through the design cycle. We need a design cycle for our lives, but lives are more complex than inventing a more amazing toaster. So, we need a better design cycle—a divine design cycle. The Bible calls this divine design cycle </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">seeking the Kingdom of Heaven</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""none""> </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Seek the Kingdom of God </span><span data-contrast=""none"">above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need. (Matthew 6: 33)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none""><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-20451"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1914"" height=""1276"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg 1914w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-900x600.jpg 900w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px""></a></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Three things are immediately clear if we want to exceed expectations for a successful life: we need to prioritize, clarify, and live righteously. Most important things in life require focus—setting priorities. Right now, if you are a student, you are probably focusing on your studies. Seeking the Kingdom of God will actually help you do that better because that is one of the things you need and seeking the Kingdom is the divine design cycle in action.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Perhaps that seems counter intuitive. In a complex world, sometimes the correct focus is not always the most obvious one. Let me quickly add that there is no guarantee that if you focus on ‘spiritual’ stuff you will pass all your classes. I am not saying something that simple. Sadly, I have seen some good people in our ministry struggle academically.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">To </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">correctly</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> focus on the Kingdom of God, we need to clarify what it is (and how it works). The Kingdom of God is living life under God’s rule and interacting with God, other people, and the earth in a wholistic and wholesome manner. The Kingdom of God is a (complex) system that produces success as measured by God’s standard of success—abundant life (John 10: 10). You are probably familiar with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. </span><span data-contrast=""none"">The Bible would define what Maslow calls ‘self-esteem needs’ differently but otherwise Maslow’s classification of needs is a good place to start. Some people think that the Bible is only interested in ‘spiritual needs’ whatever those might be, but the Kingdom of God is about all your needs. It is wholistic.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Our needs should drive us to seek the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God is where God’s grace meets our needs (Hebrews 4: 16; 1 Corinthians 4: 20), and we receive the abundant life (John 10: 10). God’s grace comes to us through spiritual disciplines and His gifts of creation and the church. If we want God’s grace we must seek humbly (Prov. 3: 34 cf. Cloud &amp; Townsend, 1995, p. 22). Clearly, we seek grace by asking through prayer. I would also include counseling with a mature, gifted believer (or listening to sermons on the topic), and Bible study. While some if this should be done alone, it is very important to be part of a small group of believers doing life on life (more about this in the section on shining below). If you have more of a physical need, the gifts of creation can also be the grace of God. For example, God created salicylate-containing plants from which we derive aspirin </span><span aria-label=""Rich text content control""><span data-contrast=""none"">​</span><span data-contrast=""none"">(Miner &amp; Hoffhines, 2007)</span><span data-contrast=""none"">​</span></span><span data-contrast=""none"">. One way to think of the means of grace is </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">figs</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">, </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">friends</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">, and </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">faith</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">. In the Old Testament the picture of a life where all your needs have been met was of sitting under your own fig tree (Zechariah 3: 10). God often works through people like friends (Acts 9: 10-17). And, finally, God can give grace directly through faithful prayer (James 1: 5-8).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Our greatest need is for a relationship with God. Our sins separate us from God, so we cannot expect much from God until we repent of our sin and ask forgiveness (Acts 2: 38-40). God can justly forgive us because Christ died on the cross to pay for our sins (Colossians 1: 20). If you have not done so already, ask God to forgive you and bring you into the Kingdom of God (Colossians 1: 13). Then you can truly seek the Kingdom of God and have a successful life.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">God also wants to use us to be a means of grace in the world. In the same sermon where Jesus told us to seek the Kingdom, He also told His followers that they were salt and light (Matthew 5: 13-16).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Salt speaks of our pure character. In 2 Kings (2: 20-21), the prophet Elisha takes salt and symbolically purifies a spring that had been causing death. When we come into God’s Kingdom, He gives us the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5: 22) which is a pure character conformed to the image of Christ, not the culture around us (Romans 8: 29; 12: 2). Developing character takes time and spiritual disciplines can be helpful means of grace in this regard (Arthur, 2021; Foster, 2018; Whitney, 2014).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Light shines. Character comes before deeds but not without deeds. Just as you need friends to meet your needs, you need to meet the needs of others. To this end, God gives each of us in His Kingdom a spiritual gift (Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4). Spiritual gifts are often like talents or skills, but sometimes are truly miraculous. To find meaning and purpose in life (Maslow’s self-actualization), you need to exercise your spiritual gifts (usually as part of team) to bring about the extension of the Kingdom of God so that more people can experience God’s grace and lead successful lives.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">So, there you have it. If you want to have success—to have your needs met beyond your expectations, you must seek, salt, and shine by using the means of grace in the Kingdom of God.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">– What has shaped my values growing up, I would say are the hardships and personal experiences I’ve encountered. During those difficult times my mom was our anchor and still is to this day.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">– I started taking my first classes here at AUHS in the Fall of 2022. - I chose to go to AUHS because it was one of the schools that I felt I was more drawn to as I was doing my research and consultations with other private schools due to their faith and values. It is also my mom’s alma mater and I hope that one day she’ll be able to see me walk and graduate here! </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">– I love to run when I have free time and spending time with family and my two siberian huskies named Appa and Cloud.

There were many excellent presentations, but Dr. Lambrecht’s presentation on burnout among pathologists stressed (pun intended) the need for a supportive community. Pathologists have very stressful workloads and, after a period of time, many experience burnout. Among other things that Dr. Lambrecht suggested would help prevent burnout was building community.&nbsp; This is, as our regular readers should know, the goal of our campus ministry, Salt and Light.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">21 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">“That is how it will be for whoever stores things away for themselves but is not rich in the sight of God.” (Luke 12)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">How do we become rich in God’s eyes, riches that lead to a close relationship with God and others?&nbsp; The answer is a robust system that balances inputs and outputs so as to minimize distress and avoid burnout. The Bible calls this system the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; While it will not be fully in place until God makes the new creation, we can enjoy many benefits today, and avoid burnout. Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 outline what we need to do to enjoy these benefits together.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Romans reminds us that we start by becoming transformed by God. As we repent of our sins, God’s Spirit begins to provide us with the circumstances that lead to character formation. The Spirit gives us ‘gifts’ which are special abilities to meet the needs of others. As we interact in a virtuous manner applying our gifts to the needs of others a strong system—the body of Christ—develops and we find that we are more resilient.&nbsp; Certainly, a healthy diet and good exercise we build a certain amount of resilience, but to be in top form we need the Kingdom of God.</p>

Maxwell).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}""> As President Ryan noted this is the cornerstone of healthcare. It takes many specialties to address today’s complex health issues.&nbsp; To address these issues we need to meet together as in the conferences held this month at AUHS. First was the 7th Annual Behavioral Health and Post-Acute Care Symposium which addressed a number of mental health issues, and next was the 9th International Summer School on Stress which focused on stress reduction and resilience. One of the presentations on resilience highlighted the need for community—another type of team.&nbsp; The ideal community is the Kingdom of God which is discussed in this month’s Salt and Light. Finally we highlight two important team members: an alumna and a faculty member. The poem this month reminds us that God is the most important person on your team.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">During the holy week of Christianity, the most well-known day, besides Holy Friday, is probably Holy Thursday when Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples. But before breaking the bread &amp; offering wine to the apostles, an unusual event happened: “Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him (John 13:1–5).” Jesus did this with dignified humility, with a call to his disciples: “[13] Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. [14] If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet. [15] For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.” – as described in The King James Version of the bible. Thus, foot washing is more than a sign of hospitality and forgiveness of sins; it’s also a call for action!&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Fortunately, AUHS has a long-standing tradition in offering a “Lamp Unto My Feet” service on this day of the Holy Week where students and faculty members wash the feet of homes people in Long Beach. In addition to foot washing, health check services (e.g., medication reconciliation, blood pressure and blood glucose level checks) are also offered, in addition to distributing ‘health bags and grocery items. This year these actions were performed on Thursday, March 28, at the AUHS-affiliated ‘A Church of Love” (including American Theological University) on Orange Avenue in Long Beach, CA. Dozens of AUHS nursing and pharmacy students as well as several faculty members of Schools of Nursing, Pharmacy, and Medicine volunteered their services.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Brent Davis, Campus Ministry Coordinator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Hope is an important concept in the Bible. Hope gives us resilience. Psalm 37, one of my favorites, says: “</span><span data-contrast=""none"">Put your </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">hope</span></b><span data-contrast=""none""> in the </span><span data-contrast=""none"">Lord</span><span data-contrast=""none"">. Travel steadily along his path. He will honor you by giving you the land. You will see the wicked destroyed” (v. 34, NLT). Our hope or confidence in a good outcome is dependent on what or whom our hope is based. Hope of winning the lottery is almost certain to be dashed. Hope of getting a good return from the stock market is somewhat reasonable but hope in the Lord is a guarantee of a good outcome.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
