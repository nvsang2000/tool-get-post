<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>With Alek Haliliyan&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I was born and raised in Kuwait City, Kuwait, and moved to the U.S. when I was 12 years old.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">My parents have been married for 23 years and have worked really hard to provide my brother and I a comfortable life.

Both religions taught me how to be respectful; especially towards my elders; it helped shape my cultural values and I also learned right from wrong. My family in Kuwait also played a huge part because they taught me how to be caring and empathetic through difficult situations. I have learned that dark times are temporary and there is always light at the end of the tunnel.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I applied to AUHS in Spring of 2023 after I didn’t make it into an ADN program. I knew AUHS was the right school for me because when God closes one door, he will open another. My motivation to join AUHS was its Christian values and its accelerated BSN program. My amazing advisor at the time, Miss Jessica Ayala, was really encouraging and helped guide me through the enrollment process which is another reason I chose AUHS.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I love spending time with my family and going shopping. Nursing school is tough and time-consuming so [when there is] any chance I get to spend quality time with my loved ones, I am happy. I also try to volunteer for AUHS charity events.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;I plan to graduate nursing school, become a registered nurse, and help my parents retire early because they have sacrificed everything for me to get where I am. I owe all of my success to my parents and to God. My dream job is to become a pediatric nurse, but I am also considering aesthetic nursing. However, I will be happy as a nurse as long as I get to help people.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Psalm 23 is a beautiful expression of the joy of having a good shepherd.&nbsp; A shepherd meets the needs of his sheep. What do sheep need—a lot of the same things we need: food, water, security, healthcare, and love.&nbsp; Look again at the familiar words:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There is a spiritual side to this provision as well. Philip Keller writes about the peaceful streams that “earth’s religions, pagan worship, and human philosophy is bound up with this insatiable thirst for God” (2015, p. 39). He goes on to discuss how the application of oil protects the sheep against parasitic flies which he likens to the irritations in our lives (Keller, 2015, p. 103). Yes, we have a shepherd he takes care of us so that we flourish!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One other thing, to get all these benefits the sheep need to follow the shepherd. We all need to follow the good shepherd to have everything that we need.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> The School of Pharmacy recently graduated its third cohort of students. Already, in its brief history, the school has contributed to the healthcare workforce of the country by educating and training the next generation of pharmacists. Our ethos lies in the simple facts,  inspire strong Christian values; practice evidence-based, patient-centered care; and foster a community of research and scholarship, so as to meet the healthcare needs of diverse patient populations. Following this armature, our students go out into the world with an aim to reduce healthcare disparities and render healthcare to the underprivileged and underserved and serve their communities.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

It truly “takes a village…,” as students need the support system outside of their professors and school system to graduate from a rigorous discipline as pharmacy. Three years of academic rigor, sleepless nights, and many an exam, the commencement is not only a culmination but a promise of realizing the fruits of their labor. As part of the commencement exercises, we celebrate the efforts of our graduates but at the same time they take the oath of the pharmacist, that reiterates to one and all, the promise of putting their education into practice for the welfare of the patients and serving the public.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commencement traces its roots back to medieval monastic rituals, where education was relegated to the clergy. The symbols and the pageantry have deep rooted meanings, that go back again to toil and hard work in pursuing one’s goals. At the end of the day, education, is a great equalizer and we celebrate it during commencement and welcome the new graduates to the fold by eliciting a promise to serve those who are entrusted to our care. The School of Pharmacy continues to build on its mission of education healthcare professionals committed to serving.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> A final word to our graduates, as their beaming faces traversed the stage, clutching their diplomas, the journey as a pharmacist has just begun. Miles to go, before we can rest and people to serve. Let’s hold on to our values, keep the faith, and practice this wonderful profession with utmost integrity and passion.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The American University of Health and Sciences School of Nursing (SON) marked two significant milestones on Friday, July 12, 2024: the Pinning Ceremony and Graduation of BSN degree candidates from the esteemed class of 2024. These events hold immense significance for our students, symbolizing their transition from student nurses to registered nurses, and for the nursing profession as a whole. The Pinning Ceremony and Graduation are not just formalities, but they are deeply rooted in the history and values of nursing, signifying the students’ readiness to serve and the profession’s recognition of their commitment.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Known as the mother of modern nursing, Florence was awarded the Red Cross of St. George in the 1860s for her tireless work during the Crimean War. In a gesture of shared honor, Florence presented a medal of excellence to her brightest graduates. This act inspired the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas Hospital in London to design and award all nurses a badge with a Maltese Cross upon their program completion. By 1916, the practice of the pinning ceremony had become a standard across the United States and England. The badge symbolizes educated women competent to serve as nurses and provide society with healthcare. A faculty member followed the graduates onto the stage during the ceremony, where they were given the nursing pin. This is often an emotional portion of the ceremony for students and faculty, marking their transition from student nurses to registered nurses, symbolizing the support and guidance faculty have provided throughout the students’ journey. The faculty’s role in the students’ journey is crucial, and their support and guidance are deeply appreciated.  This act was followed by the Nightingale Pledge and a candle-lighting ceremony to commemorate Florence Nightingale’s use of candlelight to help wounded soldiers at night. At AUHS, this act was followed by the Blessing of the Hands, a symbolic representation of how the hands should be used to deliver care and compassion and bless all that nurses encounter.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commencement, in the context of nursing, typically refers to the ceremony held to celebrate and officially recognize the completion of a nursing program by its students. It is often called a graduation ceremony or gathering. During commencement, nursing students receive their diplomas or degrees, marking their transition from student nurses to registered nurses or advanced practice nurses. This transition is not just a milestone but a testament to the dedication and commitment of the new nurses to the nursing profession. It’s a significant milestone where graduates, their families, faculty, and often healthcare professionals come together to honor the new nurses’ achievements and unwavering commitment to the nursing profession, invoking a sense of pride and admiration in the audience.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">We extend our heartfelt congratulations to our students for their remarkable achievements. As they embark on their journey to make a positive impact on the world, we offer our blessings and best wishes for their future endeavors.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As we recently celebrated the Fourth of July, I want to take a moment to reflect on two key principles that will shape your experience here at AUHS: freedom and responsibility.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">College is a time of unparalleled freedom. You have the opportunity to explore new ideas, pursue your passions, and make decisions that will influence your future.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Drug discovery and drug development are essential to the creation of therapeutic solutions which all heath care professionals employ in the art of healing. These involve complex processes that begin with the discovery of the new drug molecule, its testing in cells and animals, and, finally, its trials in humans. Proving that the new drug molecule is both safe and effective for the indication requires extensive clinical trials in human subjects and patients. This endeavor is highly regulated by the government to ensure that all drugs approved are both safe and efficacious. While physician-investigators conduct the trials, clinical research professionals facilitate, oversee and manage them at the clinic or the institution.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">John, I read your research title “Nutritional deficiencies that may predispose to long COVID” and it gave me some interesting thoughts. As a dentist, I focus on the overall health of my patients every day, and the connection between oral health and nutrition is very close. If nutritional deficiencies can indeed affect our resistance to COVID, it has important implications for how we advise patients to adjust their diets and supplement with vitamins and minerals. What are your thoughts on this topic?</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Answer from Dr. John:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It is important to be comprehensive in your approach to supplements. There are macrosupplements that are important in addition to the microsupplements contained in the average multivitamin supplement. These include things like taurine, not usually included in most supplements, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">N</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">-acetylcysteine (better pharmacokinetics and fewer side effects than cysteine), beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals, and essential amino acids. Getting the amounts right and not overdosing on those that can have toxic consequences (e.g., zinc and selenium) or are provided in an abnormal form with questionable pharmacology (e.g., cyanocobalamin for B12) can be difficult. There are some potential dietary supplements that are not currently commercially available or even on the nutritional supplement ‘radar’, like dolichol. Limiting total caloric intake has long been known to retard aging and extend lifespan but few know that this is, in part, due to a reduction in dietary methionine intake. Diet and dietary supplements are complex topics with a considerable amount of misinformation due to commercial interests from various directions. It is also a moving target because we really don’t know everything.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">How do we meet needs? First, you need to clearly identify the needs and then set a goal. Next, you need a plan to meet that goal. This is what we do every day at AUHS. Read on to learn more about meeting needs and meeting those who meet needs like our student, Louisse Castillo, and our nursing professor, Jeazale Julian!</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>Student Services: Salt and Light&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Brent Davis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><span data-contrast=""auto""><strong>Do you have a plan for meeting your needs? </strong>Whether they are plans for lunch or plans for retirement, I am sure you do. Ideally, we don’t want to just get by, we want to be successful, to exceed our needs (or expectations). When a company wants to provide a new product to meet a need, it goes through the design cycle. We need a design cycle for our lives, but lives are more complex than inventing a more amazing toaster. So, we need a better design cycle—a divine design cycle. The Bible calls this divine design cycle </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">seeking the Kingdom of Heaven</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""none""> </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Seek the Kingdom of God </span><span data-contrast=""none"">above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need. (Matthew 6: 33)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none""><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-20451"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1914"" height=""1276"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3.jpg 1914w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3-900x600.jpg 900w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px""></a></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Three things are immediately clear if we want to exceed expectations for a successful life: we need to prioritize, clarify, and live righteously. Most important things in life require focus—setting priorities. Right now, if you are a student, you are probably focusing on your studies. Seeking the Kingdom of God will actually help you do that better because that is one of the things you need and seeking the Kingdom is the divine design cycle in action.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Perhaps that seems counter intuitive. In a complex world, sometimes the correct focus is not always the most obvious one. Let me quickly add that there is no guarantee that if you focus on ‘spiritual’ stuff you will pass all your classes. I am not saying something that simple. Sadly, I have seen some good people in our ministry struggle academically.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">To </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">correctly</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> focus on the Kingdom of God, we need to clarify what it is (and how it works). The Kingdom of God is living life under God’s rule and interacting with God, other people, and the earth in a wholistic and wholesome manner. The Kingdom of God is a (complex) system that produces success as measured by God’s standard of success—abundant life (John 10: 10). You are probably familiar with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. </span><span data-contrast=""none"">The Bible would define what Maslow calls ‘self-esteem needs’ differently but otherwise Maslow’s classification of needs is a good place to start. Some people think that the Bible is only interested in ‘spiritual needs’ whatever those might be, but the Kingdom of God is about all your needs. It is wholistic.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Our needs should drive us to seek the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God is where God’s grace meets our needs (Hebrews 4: 16; 1 Corinthians 4: 20), and we receive the abundant life (John 10: 10). God’s grace comes to us through spiritual disciplines and His gifts of creation and the church. If we want God’s grace we must seek humbly (Prov. 3: 34 cf. Cloud &amp; Townsend, 1995, p. 22). Clearly, we seek grace by asking through prayer. I would also include counseling with a mature, gifted believer (or listening to sermons on the topic), and Bible study. While some if this should be done alone, it is very important to be part of a small group of believers doing life on life (more about this in the section on shining below). If you have more of a physical need, the gifts of creation can also be the grace of God. For example, God created salicylate-containing plants from which we derive aspirin </span><span aria-label=""Rich text content control""><span data-contrast=""none"">​</span><span data-contrast=""none"">(Miner &amp; Hoffhines, 2007)</span><span data-contrast=""none"">​</span></span><span data-contrast=""none"">. One way to think of the means of grace is </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">figs</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">, </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">friends</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">, and </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">faith</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">. In the Old Testament the picture of a life where all your needs have been met was of sitting under your own fig tree (Zechariah 3: 10). God often works through people like friends (Acts 9: 10-17). And, finally, God can give grace directly through faithful prayer (James 1: 5-8).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Our greatest need is for a relationship with God. Our sins separate us from God, so we cannot expect much from God until we repent of our sin and ask forgiveness (Acts 2: 38-40). God can justly forgive us because Christ died on the cross to pay for our sins (Colossians 1: 20). If you have not done so already, ask God to forgive you and bring you into the Kingdom of God (Colossians 1: 13). Then you can truly seek the Kingdom of God and have a successful life.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">God also wants to use us to be a means of grace in the world. In the same sermon where Jesus told us to seek the Kingdom, He also told His followers that they were salt and light (Matthew 5: 13-16).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Salt speaks of our pure character. In 2 Kings (2: 20-21), the prophet Elisha takes salt and symbolically purifies a spring that had been causing death. When we come into God’s Kingdom, He gives us the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5: 22) which is a pure character conformed to the image of Christ, not the culture around us (Romans 8: 29; 12: 2). Developing character takes time and spiritual disciplines can be helpful means of grace in this regard (Arthur, 2021; Foster, 2018; Whitney, 2014).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Light shines. Character comes before deeds but not without deeds. Just as you need friends to meet your needs, you need to meet the needs of others. To this end, God gives each of us in His Kingdom a spiritual gift (Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4). Spiritual gifts are often like talents or skills, but sometimes are truly miraculous. To find meaning and purpose in life (Maslow’s self-actualization), you need to exercise your spiritual gifts (usually as part of team) to bring about the extension of the Kingdom of God so that more people can experience God’s grace and lead successful lives.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">So, there you have it. If you want to have success—to have your needs met beyond your expectations, you must seek, salt, and shine by using the means of grace in the Kingdom of God.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">– What has shaped my values growing up, I would say are the hardships and personal experiences I’ve encountered. During those difficult times my mom was our anchor and still is to this day.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">– I started taking my first classes here at AUHS in the Fall of 2022. - I chose to go to AUHS because it was one of the schools that I felt I was more drawn to as I was doing my research and consultations with other private schools due to their faith and values. It is also my mom’s alma mater and I hope that one day she’ll be able to see me walk and graduate here! </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">– I love to run when I have free time and spending time with family and my two siberian huskies named Appa and Cloud.

There were many excellent presentations, but Dr. Lambrecht’s presentation on burnout among pathologists stressed (pun intended) the need for a supportive community. Pathologists have very stressful workloads and, after a period of time, many experience burnout. Among other things that Dr. Lambrecht suggested would help prevent burnout was building community.&nbsp; This is, as our regular readers should know, the goal of our campus ministry, Salt and Light.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">21 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">“That is how it will be for whoever stores things away for themselves but is not rich in the sight of God.” (Luke 12)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">How do we become rich in God’s eyes, riches that lead to a close relationship with God and others?&nbsp; The answer is a robust system that balances inputs and outputs so as to minimize distress and avoid burnout. The Bible calls this system the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; While it will not be fully in place until God makes the new creation, we can enjoy many benefits today, and avoid burnout. Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 outline what we need to do to enjoy these benefits together.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Romans reminds us that we start by becoming transformed by God. As we repent of our sins, God’s Spirit begins to provide us with the circumstances that lead to character formation. The Spirit gives us ‘gifts’ which are special abilities to meet the needs of others. As we interact in a virtuous manner applying our gifts to the needs of others a strong system—the body of Christ—develops and we find that we are more resilient.&nbsp; Certainly, a healthy diet and good exercise we build a certain amount of resilience, but to be in top form we need the Kingdom of God.</p>

It takes many specialties to address today’s complex health issues.&nbsp; To address these issues we need to meet together as in the conferences held this month at AUHS. First was the 7th Annual Behavioral Health and Post-Acute Care Symposium which addressed a number of mental health issues, and next was the 9th International Summer School on Stress which focused on stress reduction and resilience. One of the presentations on resilience highlighted the need for community—another type of team.&nbsp; The ideal community is the Kingdom of God which is discussed in this month’s Salt and Light. Finally we highlight two important team members: an alumna and a faculty member. The poem this month reminds us that God is the most important person on your team.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">During the holy week of Christianity, the most well-known day, besides Holy Friday, is probably Holy Thursday when Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples. But before breaking the bread &amp; offering wine to the apostles, an unusual event happened: “Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him (John 13:1–5).” Jesus did this with dignified humility, with a call to his disciples: “[13] Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. [14] If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet. [15] For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.” – as described in The King James Version of the bible. Thus, foot washing is more than a sign of hospitality and forgiveness of sins; it’s also a call for action!&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Fortunately, AUHS has a long-standing tradition in offering a “Lamp Unto My Feet” service on this day of the Holy Week where students and faculty members wash the feet of homes people in Long Beach. In addition to foot washing, health check services (e.g., medication reconciliation, blood pressure and blood glucose level checks) are also offered, in addition to distributing ‘health bags and grocery items. This year these actions were performed on Thursday, March 28, at the AUHS-affiliated ‘A Church of Love” (including American Theological University) on Orange Avenue in Long Beach, CA. Dozens of AUHS nursing and pharmacy students as well as several faculty members of Schools of Nursing, Pharmacy, and Medicine volunteered their services.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Hope is an important concept in the Bible. Hope gives us resilience. Psalm 37, one of my favorites, says: “</span><span data-contrast=""none"">Put your </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">hope</span></b><span data-contrast=""none""> in the </span><span data-contrast=""none"">Lord</span><span data-contrast=""none"">. Travel steadily along his path. He will honor you by giving you the land. You will see the wicked destroyed” (v. 34, NLT). Our hope or confidence in a good outcome is dependent on what or whom our hope is based. Hope of winning the lottery is almost certain to be dashed. Hope of getting a good return from the stock market is somewhat reasonable but hope in the Lord is a guarantee of a good outcome.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Eddie Vargas, Center for Academic Success Coordinator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When you reach the pinnacle of any endeavor, some may ask how you got there; but what is the question you must ask yourself? Well, the answer is simple: “How do I stay here?” You’ve already answered all the questions thrown at you, and you “made it”, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">but how do you stay there</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">? Time and time again, we’ve seen a contender become the champion, only to be supplanted by a hungrier, more ambitious opponent. As psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson puts it: “But success makes us complacent. We forget to pay attention. We take what we have for granted. We turn a blind eye. We fail to notice that things are changing, or that corruption is taking root. And everything falls apart. Is that the fault of reality—of God? Or do things fall apart because we have not paid sufficient attention.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.” – Proverbs 6:10-11</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">What about the outliers? The few who reach the pinnacle of success, and stay there. The teams or individuals who go undefeated, the ones who make it to the summit and leave while they’re still at the top. </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">How do they do it?</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-scaled.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-20362"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-scaled.jpg"" alt="""" width=""2560"" height=""1707"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-900x600.jpg 900w"" sizes=""(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px""></a>We may not realize it, but we choose to be complacent, we choose to be naïve – perhaps because we’re afraid to fail, or because we’re afraid of the harsh truths of reality. The difference between those who visit the summit and those who stay there is this: Those who stay there never grow complacent, they choose to pay attention, they seek opportunities to improve, and they know what they’re aiming at. As Norman Vincent Peale puts it: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">“If you want to be excellent, staying consistent with your goals and positive habits over time will separate you from the herd of mediocrity. It all starts with a goal. If you don’t have a destination in mind, you’re just adrift at sea going with the flow.” – Jordan Peterson</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">AUHS’s final BSN course, N460, is a course of high standards. Students must meet a predetermined benchmark for all exams. These benchmarks are higher than the testing platforms’ own benchmarks. Students are made aware of this benchmark from the get-go, they come into N460 with a goal, with something to aim for. All the knowledge they’ve compiled over the past 2-3 years is tested, literally, for eleven weeks. Although the benchmarks have been consistent with N460 for some time, the course itself is evolving, constantly being improved to avoid complacency and to keep the standard of success high.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The ultimate goal for both AUHS and the BSN students is to pass the NCLEX. Students – and those preparing the students – know what they’re aiming for. N460 has been improved and modified, even after the past two cohorts hit 100% on the NCLEX – not necessarily by taking things away, but by adding unto things that worked well!&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Hope in the realm of health sciences is not merely an abstract concept but a vital force that propels progress, innovation, and transformation. It serves as a guiding light, illuminating the path towards a better, healthier future for individuals and society as a whole. Hope is not a wishful thought; it’s an essential ingredient that empowers us to tackle complex health challenges. It inspires us to persevere through obstacles, reminding us that each setback is not a roadblock but an opportunity for growth and learning. Hope fosters resilience, encouraging us to keep pushing forward even when the journey seems arduous.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Diversity and inclusion in healthcare are crucial components for providing appropriate and optimal care to patients of different cultures. Diversity encompasses differences in race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, socioeconomic status, and more. Inclusion involves creating an environment where these differences are respected, valued, and integrated into all aspects of care delivery. To me, diversity and inclusion mean recognizing and embracing the unique backgrounds and needs of every individual, regardless of their cultural background. In providing care to patients from diverse cultures, understanding fundamental cultural ideas, language, and religious beliefs is essential. Making assumptions about patients based on their culture can lead to misunderstandings and suboptimal care. Building trust through respectful communication and actively listening to patients’ concerns fosters a therapeutic relationship that is essential for effective care delivery. Moreover, educating patients about medications and treatment options in a culturally sensitive manner ensures that they are informed and empowered to participate in their healthcare decisions. Demonstrating a commitment to diversity and inclusion on campus can take various forms. This may include participating in multicultural events, advocating for inclusive policies, and actively engaging with diverse student groups. By promoting dialogue and understanding among peers, we can create a more inclusive environment that celebrates diversity and values the contributions of individuals from all backgrounds.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Representing an underrepresented group in pharmacy positively impacts the profession, the community, and patient care in several ways. First, diversity in the pharmacy profession promotes innovation and creativity by bringing together individuals with different perspectives and experiences. This diversity of thought enables pharmacists to develop more effective strategies for addressing the unique healthcare needs of diverse patient populations. Additionally, pharmacists from underrepresented groups serve as role models and mentors for aspiring healthcare professionals who may identify with similar backgrounds. By increasing representation within the profession, we inspire future generations to pursue careers in pharmacy, thereby fostering greater diversity in healthcare overall. From a community perspective, pharmacists who reflect the diversity of the population they serve are better equipped to understand and address the cultural and linguistic barriers that may affect patient care. This leads to improved patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and health outcomes.&nbsp; embracing diversity and inclusion in pharmacy practice enhances the quality of care provided to patients from different cultural backgrounds. By valuing and respecting the unique perspectives and experiences of individuals, we can create a more equitable and patient-centered healthcare system.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In addition to English, I am fluent in Afaan Oromo, Amharic, and Swahili, stemming from my upbringing in Ethiopia. This multilingual proficiency significantly enhances my capacity as a pharmacist, enriching communication and fostering deeper connections with diverse patient demographics.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The ability to converse fluently in multiple languages transcends mere linguistic proficiency; it embodies cultural competence and empathy, essential components in delivering patient-centered care. In a profession where effective communication is paramount, my linguistic versatility enables me to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps, thereby facilitating clearer comprehension of medical instructions, medication regimens, and health education materials.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Moreover, my proficiency in Afaan Oromo, Amharic, and Swahili empowers me to cultivate trust and rapport with patients from Ethiopian and Swahili-speaking communities, fostering a sense of inclusivity and reassurance in healthcare settings. This inclusivity not only enhances patient satisfaction but also contributes to improved health outcomes by ensuring patients feel understood, respected, and supported throughout their healthcare journey.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In a broader context, my linguistic skills serve as a conduit for promoting health literacy and public health initiatives within ethnically diverse communities.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When I was younger, I ran across a quote that resonates with the values I was brought up with and how they have shaped the way I am now. The quote by Sol Peralta states, “Your individuality is important, but so is belonging. Recognize the parts of your culture that have shaped your past, and the parts you want to carry with you into the future”.&nbsp; Growing up in a Mexican American house hold, our grandfather taught us the value in helping others first before ourselves and that family is priority. Our parents had full time jobs that limited them from spending a lot of time with my sister and I, thus making our grandparents our primary caretakers. I learned how to speak fluent English from my parents and fluent Spanish from my grandparents. They always stressed the importance of being bilingual. When I became old enough, I began to translate for them everywhere we went. I found joy in helping them feel understood and delighted that they were able to communicate and receive the correct information. It wasn’t until later in my career that I realized how important translating for others really was. I was fortunate enough to be hired at a community pharmacy at nineteen years old. There is where my journey as a bilingual Spanish speaking pharmacy technician began. I realized I was the only Spanish speaking technician at most Rite Aid community pharmacy locations. For over ten years, I have assisted many pharmacists by translating questions patients had for them. This ensured that patients were being communicated with correctly and medications were being safely administered. Being able to speak fluent Spanish brings a positive impact in underserved pharmacy communities by allowing the patients to feel comfortable asking questions and receive the patient care along with medication information they need. People are more open to speaking with others that speak their native language.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;With the Hispanic population continuing to grow all over California, the need for bilingual Spanish speakers is needed now more than ever. Patients who aren’t able to understand their health care providers are less likely to be compliant with their medications or schedule follow up visits. I am proud to be the bridge that is needed for patient- centered care in underserved communities. Being part of an underrepresented group in healthcare makes me feel a sense of belonging and appreciation. I have found that most of our patients remember the times I have made them feel cared for. In fact, many still ask for me and many of them have transferred to my current pharmacy location. Being bilingual has truly helped build trust filled meaningful relationships with our new and current patients. Although, there are many paths for pharmacist, I believe that working in community pharmacist might be the best fit for me. Having around ten years of work experience in over six diverse community pharmacies, has allowed me to become culturally competent about many cultures and aid in providing the best patient-centered care possible. Going back to Sol Peralta’s quote, my culture and values I have learned have shaped me as a compassionate health care worker that will continue to be the bridge that helps Spanish speaking communities in my present and future career as a pharmacist. The Walgreens Multilingual Scholarship would be a huge help with my financial circumstance during the time I attend American University of Health sciences as a PharmD candidate, due to the fact that I am working less hours in order to make sure of my academic success. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to describe the positive impacts to patient-care related to the pharmacy field that I have experienced by being bilingual.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559731&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Physicians, especially pathologists like me, have been exposed to death many times, almost used to it (as many would say), but when this hits home, e.g., in the framework of ‘here and now’; we are also stunned… This recently happened to me on one Saturday in February: our best American friends (parents of my youngest son’s best friend from elementary and high school) invited us for a dinner and the event passed in excellent mood, and we all departed smiling, with plans for the next outing… Yet, Tuesday morning I got a phone call that Larry (67 years old, in perfect health, who had gone to a hot yoga class earlier that morning) had dropped dead at home, while his son saw him gasping for air, before bending over his desk, and becoming pulseless. His son called 911 and started CPR. The medical emergency team arrived in about 8 mins, started professional resuscitation, rushed him to the hospital, but Larry could not be revived, not even after electric shocks…</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The shock in his and my family was associated with a puzzle: Larry was not only relatively young and very healthy, but living the healthiest lifestyle preventive medicine can provide, e.g., doing almost daily physical or yoga exercises, until a few years ago swimming in the ocean several miles/week, eating very healthy food, taking multivitamins and controlling his blood pressure – yet he succumbed to sudden death… Since his family didn’t want an autopsy performed that would have established or narrowed down the cause of his death, in subsequent days, I reviewed for his family the likely causes of a sudden death:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The most frequent causes of sudden death are cardiac or pulmonary in origin (stroke is often implied improperly):</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">Myocardial infarction (MI) is a frequent etiology</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">. This is due to a thrombus (blood clot), usually formed on the top ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in the left coronary artery (LAD) blocking the blood supply to the left ventricle of the heart. Lack of oxygenated blood means ischemic necrosis (cell death) in the most hard-working part of the heart and necrotic cardiac wall cannot push out the oxygenated blood through the aorta to other parts of the body. MI is usually associated with sudden, excruciating pain in the left chest, often irradiating to the left arm or chin (mandible). LAD is often narrowed by expanding atherosclerosis that is, unfortunately, progressing with our age. Hence the importance of healthy diet and taking statins, (Lipitor-like drugs) is critical for all of us, especially if this is associated with mini (‘baby’) doses aspirin (81 mg) that reduces the risk of thrombus formation, in addition to other health benefits like anticancer effects. Since aspirin often damages the gastric mucosa, especially in full doses (325 mg tablets), it is advisable to take enteric coated mini aspirin tablets or the new gastro-safe (Vazalore) 81 mg version.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span><b><span data-contrast=""auto""><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOM-Image.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-20352"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOM-Image.png"" alt="""" width=""1376"" height=""702"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOM-Image.png 1376w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOM-Image-300x153.png 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOM-Image-1024x522.png 1024w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOM-Image-768x392.png 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1376px) 100vw, 1376px""></a></span></b></li>
<li><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">Cardiac arrhythmias (CA) may occur suddenly</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">, without any advance sign or symptoms and people may just collapse and die on the spot. This is the cardiac emergency when cardiac defibrillators may be lifesaving, since they may restore the normal rhythm (pulse) of the heart to about 70 bits/min. Namely, our hearts are programmed to about 70 contractions per minute, due to a small group highly specialized cardiac myocardial cells in the so-called cardiac conduction system, consisting of a sinus node (about 0.5 cm) in the wall of right atrium of the heart and atrioventricular (AVN), also about 5 – 8 mm, in the juncture of right atrium and ventricle. Although CA may strike at almost any age (e.g., we often hear and read about young athletes ‘dropping dead’ in the field), but here advanced age is also a predisposing factor. After performing or supervising more than 1000 autopsies in Boston and Long Beach, I noticed that as we age, the highly specialized cells in the conduction system are slowly being replaced by connective tissue – hence the number of rhythm-producing myocytes is gradually decreasing. Predisposing factors to CA are also well-known, since fatal CA is described in the literature after major psychologic distress (e.g., during or after major arguments in the family, or during the ‘broken heart’ syndrome after unexpected breakup with loved ones). </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></li>

These conditions slow down the venous blood flow from our lower extremities to the right side of the heart, predisposing the dilated veins to thrombus formation and if these thrombi are dislodged by the blood flow, they become emboli. If small, these emboli cause chest discomfort, cough, often difficulties in breathings, but if large (e.g., about 1 cm in diameter and 2-3 cm long – unfortunately, I have seen this in many of my autopsies) they completely block the blood flow to the lungs, resulting in immediate death. Analyzing the signs and symptoms of our friend Larry (e.g., gasping for air, no pain or preceding signs); PE was the most likely cause of his demise, likely combined with CA that could not be restored by defibrillation. Namely, if the heart does not get enough blood supply through the lungs, it goes into ‘over-drive’, often triggering fatal CA. Prevention of PE is similar to that of MI: statins, mini aspirin and frequent leg movements.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></li>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Horace Grant Underwood (1859 – 1916) was an early Christian missionary to Korea (arrived Easter Sunday, 1885). His brother, John Thomas Underwood, who founded the Underwood Typewriter Company, partially funded Horace’s mission to Korea. Horace taught physics and chemistry at the Chejungwon medical institution in Seoul, the first Western medical institution in Korea. Chejungwon was affiliated with Yonhee University, which later became Yonsei University (see the picture of the statue of Horace Underwood on the campus of Yonsei University below). Horace Underwood also collaborated with other missionaries to translate the Bible into Korean. His descendants have played, and continue to play, a significant role in Korean history. His only son, Horace H. Underwood, became president of Yonhee University (now Yonsei University), which his father founded. His grandson, Horace G. Underwood II, served on the board of trustees at Yonsei University until his death in 2004. He also served as an interpreter in the Korean War armistice talks. His great grandson, Horace H. Underwood II, served as director of the international division of Yonsei University and later became the executive director of the Fulbright program in Korea. One of Horace Underwood’s great, great grandsons, William David Underwood II, married my daughter, Carol Marie Underwood (née Schloss). Carol Underwood gave birth to a great, great, great grandson of Horace Underwood, Wesley Peter Underwood, on April 12, 2022. I hope to visit my grandson Wesley again during the inter-quarter break in March.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This Holy Week is also the first week of the spring term; it is also the celebration of Purim. This all means that this is a time of hope and new beginnings. As President Ryan noted, this is a good time to reflect. In this issue you will find reflections on diversity, the family of a missionary to Korea, sudden death, and the meaning of Easter. To balance these reflections, there is a very practical article on the resources available for testing in the library.&nbsp; Finally, we end with an Alumni Profile and Pastor’s Poem. As we enter the new term let us take time to equip and reflect.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">
As the spring season approaches, we should reflect on how the spring symbolizes renewal, growth, and transformation—a sentiment that resonates deeply within academia.<br>
For students, faculty, and staff alike, the arrival of spring can bring a sense of anticipation and energy. As the days grow longer and the weather turns warmer, we can experience a renewed commitment to learning, exploration, and achievement.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Brent Davis, Campus Ministry Coordinator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Building community is not easy, but it is God’s will. Is there a command to build community? Of course, we do not see the exact words: “Thou shalt build community!” But, we do see the body of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 12: 12, Paul tells the Corinthians they are one body—the body of Christ. Commenting on this passage, Jack MacGorman writes: “There are no one-man churches!”</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>1</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> Although our campus ministry is not a church, it is a part of the body of Christ.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In verse 7 of this chapter, St. Paul instructs his readers that their gifts should be used for the benefit of all. This is a different mindset from what is encountered in some churches and ministries where the professionals are expected to provide services for the congregants. All members of the body of Christ have something to offer to as well as receive from others.&nbsp; All members build a Christ-centered community where healing, growth and service occur to the glory of God.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Creation reflects the character of the Creator. God is love (1 John 4: 8), and God is holy (Leviticus 19: 2). Holiness (or right order) is the goal; love is the motivation and disposition. Love without holiness can lead to unhealthy relationships; holiness without love can lead to alienation and discouragement.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>2</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp; Christ demonstrated these qualities as he led his disciples and, in love, died on the cross to make us holy.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Loving acceptance with accountability and support help us to achieve the goals of loving others and being holy when we accept Christ’s sacrifice for our sins and join with his body to use our spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12) to build community—providing a safe place for healing, growth, and service. Find a church that is serious about building community and/or come join us on campus for Salt and Light, Tuesdays and Thursdays.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Nicole Lesher, PhD, VP of Institutional Effectiveness&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">You may be familiar with the contemporary classic children’s book written by Laura Nueroff, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">. This delightful book is a brilliantly illustrated tale about a little boy who gives a mouse a cookie. Eating the cookie leads to the mouse wanting a glass of milk, which leads to asking for a straw and so on until the ever-so-energized mouse eventually arrives back to wanting a cookie again, while the boy is left exhausted. Over years of doing assessment for my university, I have often thought of this story. Assessment for us, just as in the story, has turned out to be quite circular, typically taking us right back to where we started.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Our university assessment program includes the use of faculty-developed, course-embedded signature assignments to assess program learning outcome competencies. These assignments are evaluated using four-point, analytic rubrics (modified AAC&amp;U VALUE rubrics developed by faculty). Curriculum maps have been developed for each program to identify where competencies are introduced, reinforced and mastered. Courses are selected in the beginning and at the end of each program to allow for both formative and summative assessment. Assignments or artifacts are embedded in these courses to gather data to assess learning outcomes. Throughout each program, faculty are tasked with assessing artifacts within their courses. Assessment data are collected across all programs and evaluated in accordance with our assessment calendar.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">An assessment team made up of faculty from each program met to assess the quantitative reasoning core competency in undergraduate programs. We assembled artifacts (with student names redacted) and assessed them ourselves – the “cookie.” While faculty had already collected and assessed artifacts across programs, participating in actual assessment and using the rubric was an excellent way to immerse the team into the process. Initially, the development exercise was created to expose the team to the rubric and the types of assignments to assess, but instead became an integral part of the assessment process.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The AAC&amp;U rubric was developed by teams of faculty and other educational professionals from over a hundred higher education institutions engaged over many months. Even so, the quantitative reasoning results were surprising due to a number of artifacts that could not be adequately assessed by the quantitative reasoning rubric used. In these cases, the assignments either did not effectively measure the outcome or the instructions needed to be modified to enable sufficient measurement. For example, one assignment required students to examine the termination of marriage, including divorce, annulment and issues of child custody and support. Students were also required to evaluate the division and allocation of property, as well as the tax implications of a divorce and to examine miscellaneous, but important issues tied to the practice of family law. These issues included the legal rights of women and the status of children, as well as the interplay between torts and other aspects of law. Having three parts to the assignment made this extremely complex for assessment purposes. Students did need to apply rules to a factual scenario, leading to a conclusion, and they were required to use math skills and the communication of quantitative information. However, the rubric is designed to assign ratings to the traits </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Interpretation, Representation, Calculation, Application/Analysis, and Communication. </span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">To assess the assignment was difficult, since the rubric required the use of data presented in graphs and/or the presentation of mathematical information, and the assignment did not.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In this assignment, mathematical results were used only minimally. The focus in the assignment is on ap-plying the rule and while quantitative data is used in the question, it did not call for real interpretation or analysis of data. Therefore, there was a mismatch between what the assignment was asking for and what we needed to measure. In another assignment, students were instructed to research a specific aspect of social psychology and write an in-depth explanation of the perspective and how it affects groups and individuals. However, the actual student work did not provide a sufficient amount of quantitative evidence to support the student’s thesis and the data used did not strongly connect the purpose of the work. With more specific instructions on what is being measured, this assignment could have been used to measure quantitative reasoning.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The ancient Romans made soap for medicinal purposes by saponification of animal fat with wood ashes. Since the Middle Ages this method of making soap has been a part of Western tradition. Fats and oils are principally composed of triglycerides. Wood ash contains carbonate salts of various metals, predominantly potassium carbonate. Heating an aqueous emulsion of triglycerides and potassium carbonate will hasten the hydrolysis of the fat to glycerin and potassium salts of the fatty acids. Saponification is the term used to refer to the conversion of an ester, such as fat or oil, to a water-soluble soap by base hydrolysis.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prominent language barrier in the Vietnamese community affects the field of pharmacy, and ultimately patient care and patient safety, because it can oftentimes lead to the misuse of medications. Many patients in the community struggle to read and understand the directions of use or administration that is provided on their prescription bottles. Although prescription labels are designed to convey only the most important information, they fail to account for non-native speakers. Some pharmacies or large retail chain companies may recognize the diversity of patient populations they serve and offer multilingual translations, however, Vietnamese is often not offered as it is not considered one of the more common second languages. As a result, Vietnamese patients misread or misinterpret their prescription instructions, which frequently lead to inappropriate use. The language barrier, in addition to a common cultural belief, drives patients to inadvertently take higher doses with the intention to recover faster. Lack of awareness and attention to the language barrier, which leads to lack of understanding, can be extremely harmful as medication underuse, misuse, and overuse (and overdose) may lead to either subtherapeutic treatment or toxic effects.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Vietnamese cultural misbelief is deciding to stop or discontinue use of their medication(s) once they start feeling better, ending their therapy abruptly or prematurely and increasing the likelihood of relapse. Without the proper education and counseling in their native language, Vietnamese patients assume the improved condition means that they can now rely on their own healing to reach full recovery since continued use may incur additional “unnecessary” expenses, which adds yet another cultural complexity. The gradual increase in medication costs fuel their decision to “power through” and ignore less severe symptoms if it means saving their hard-earned money. Thus, the language barrier has a rippling effect that perpetuates harmful and misleading approaches within the Vietnamese community. Lack of understanding and health illiteracy drives patients to make choices in which they are completely unaware of the negative long-term consequences on their well-being.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pharmacists must adopt a multi-level approach to address the language barrier and ensure that the community correctly uses their medication as prescribed. First, serving the Vietnamese community should require strong language skills, which would allow pharmacists to effectively communicate with patients and provide clear explanations. Priority should be given to specialists who can speak Vietnamese on at least intermediate level. Those who are not familiar with the language would benefit from using translation software and consulting with interpreters. They should pay attention to the patient’s English proficiency when deciding whether additional help is needed and encourage patients to ask for explanations in a non-judgmental atmosphere.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, pharmacists must focus on patient education, emphasizing proper dosage and the importance of completing the entire prescribed course of medication. This effort may involve developing educational materials in Vietnamese and culturally tailored workshops to improve health literacy within the community. Illustrations can also convey important instructions, such as dosage, frequency, and potential side effects, making the information more accessible. Culturally sensitive communication can bridge the language gap and empower patients to make informed decisions about their health.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, pharmacists should be attuned to patients’ concerns about medical costs and work to alleviate these fears by emphasizing the long-term benefits of proper medication use. This approach would help dispel the misconception that stopping medication early is a cost-saving measure. On the same note, pharmacists should help patients navigate available options and recommend appropriate cost-effective alternatives. Limited language proficiency makes such decisions more difficult, while being able to save money without interrupting treatment can improve adherence. Ultimately, prioritizing language assistance, effective communication, and patient education can help pharmacists overcome the language barrier and promote better health outcomes in the Vietnamese community.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In the changing climate of our society, thousands of Vietnamese citizens are faced with arduous tasks related to the proper maintenance of their medication therapy ranging from the mundane to the most severe of cases. The most pressing issues facing the field of pharmacy today are the language barriers and lack of healthcare access available for the Vietnamese community, especially the elderly Vietnamese community. Considering how difficult it is for native English speakers to navigate the healthcare complexities of their everyday lives, it is likely that non-native English speakers are confronted with even more adverse circumstances. With over 200,000 Vietnamese citizens residing in Orange County, California, this makes up the largest population of Vietnamese citizens outside of Vietnam. There are approximately 2.3 million Vietnamese citizens residing in the United States, according to the 2023 census. To emphasize a growing concern, a vast majority of the Vietnamese population in the United States face language barriers that prevent them from properly communicating their medical needs with healthcare professionals. This can be extremely consequential for these patients, making them at risk for financial hardship, worsening or prolonged ailments, and even death. A proposal for this problem in the community would be to offer electives in pharmacy school curriculums that educate students on Medical Vietnamese. In these elective courses, students will learn the basic pharmaceutical terminology in a context that focuses on patient care. By implementing this initiative, students will be more prepared to communicate in the Vietnamese language when they go on their rotations, and when they embark on their professional careers. I plan to contribute to this solution by collaborating with student representatives from my cohort to introduce these ideas to the curriculum committee at my university, American University of Health Sciences. As students typically begin electives as early as the first academic year of the program at my institution, it will allow them enough time to hone the necessary skills in speaking, writing, and reading comprehension in order to effectively communicate with the Vietnamese community. In particular, elderly Vietnamese patients are most vulnerable to this issue as their knowledge base of English is typically minimal. From firsthand experience, elderly Vietnamese patients feel more comfortable and experience less anxiety when they meet pharmacy staff that can speak a certain level of Vietnamese to be able to guide them through their pharmacy related problems. In addition to advocacy at the academic institutional level, I would like to expand my advocacy at the city legislative level to require readily available signage and documents, such as medication guides transcribed in Vietnamese for clarity for Vietnamese speaking patients. Furthermore, I have worked as a pharmacy technician in the retail pharmacy setting where Vietnamese patients would come to speak with me regarding their pharmacy needs. Some have personally sought me out as their advocate amongst my colleagues. Some patients have went even as far as to rearrange their typical schedules or routes to commute further to come to my pharmacy due to their trust in my ability and willingness to help them succeed. Since my first encounter with a Vietnamese speaking patient, I have helped thousands of Vietnamese speaking patients on their path to better health. Regularly, I study and practice the Vietnamese language to not only benefit my patients, but to better communicate with my family members and other members of the Vietnamese community I come in contact with, especially in the Orange County area. These experiences I do not take for granted, as they have help me develop a closer connection to my heritage and culture. Interestingly enough, I have learned of the many herbal medicines often used in the Vietnamese community. This has led me to become more comfortable with working with my pharmacy staff to become more culturally competent. Cultural competency is critical as language is not the only struggle Vietnamese speaking patients have. Many members of the Vietnamese community adhere to deep cultural practices, especially in regards to healthcare and money. As a result, becoming a fluent and culturally competent Vietnamese speaker has allowed me to make a big difference in their lives in ways I never I thought I could. In the future, one of my professional goals would be to open up my own hospice pharmacy in Orange County. As business owner, I will require each one of my staff to be at least at a proficient level in the Vietnamese language. I also plan to be actively involved in many organizations that support the Vietnamese community, such as the Vietnamese Pharmacist Association. Through this involvement, I hope to advocate for more translation services to those who may need it. As many Vietnamese immigrants come from low-income backgrounds, I would also like to help spread awareness of financial programs available to help combat their financial hardships. It is my hope that this initiative will deter patients from having to decline medications, especially life-saving medications, due to inability to pay. As always, I remember to express my gratitude to my patients each time they visit my pharmacy and remind them they are not alone and that support will always be provided to them should they need it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As Dr. Ryan mentioned in her message, we are in a time of renewal which is not just at the beginning of spring but seems to be continuous. In this edition, we reflect on the meaning of the ‘White Coat Ceremony’ to our soon-to-be graduates and learn about the issues facing immigrant communities with health care from two pharmacy students who were awarded scholarships for their passion and insights. One of the key functions that helps us to renew rightly is an assessment program as described by our Vice President of Institutional Effectiveness. We also profile one of our nursing students, Melissa, and spotlight our Nursing Clinical Director.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""none"">This month we are giving you a behind-the-scenes look at one of the team members producing this </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">Trinium</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">: Jan Eunice N. Tribiana, Graphic Designer and Publication Assistant.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Jan hails from Manila, Philippines where she was </span><span data-contrast=""none"">born and raised. She graduated from the University of Santo Tomas with a Bachelor’s Degree in Fine Arts, majoring in Advertising Arts and is the eldest daughter in her family, and her father works for the government while her mother is a stay-at-home parent. She has two younger siblings: her&nbsp; brother is studying automotive servicing, and her little sister is in 7th grade. About her family she says: “We are just like any other family, always doing our best to support each other.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<span data-contrast=""none"">Family and school have shaped her values. She is grateful to have had the opportunity to receive an education that was deeply rooted in her Catholic faith: “The values and principles that were instilled in me have played a crucial role in shaping the person I am today. Being the eldest child in my family, I have also learned the importance of hard work and perseverance from my parents. Their unwavering support for my interests and passions throughout my upbringing has been a significant factor in my personal and professional growth.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Jan started working for AUHS in 2021, when the management had just started hiring outsourced employees and she was among the first hires in that group. During the pandemic, when everything was uncertain, she believes the opportunity to work for AUHS came as a blessing, and she was even more motivated to join AUHS when she learned about the diversity of the institution.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">During her spare time, she helps her family and takes care of her sister. Also, her family has always been passionate about animal welfare, particularly for cats. They regularly provide food to stray cats and take some of them to the vet to get spayed or neutered, especially the ones in her neighborhood.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Looking to the future, she aspires to further her career as a graphic designer and an artist, with a future plan of obtaining a Master’s Degree in Fine Arts.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Jan epitomizes the values of AUHS and so we shine the Spotlight on our amazingly talented graphic designer and publication assistant!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As I was praying about what to write, the Lord indicated I should write about prayer. What is prayer, and why is it important? Prayer is simply talking to God, and there is no one more important to talk to.&nbsp; How do we talk to God? When Jesus’ disciples asked this question, he gave them a model:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">2 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Jesus said to them, “When you pray, this is what you should say.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">There are two parts to this prayer: God’s glory and rule, and our needs.&nbsp; The order is important. Start your prayer with a focus on God’s purposes. Ultimately, the key to happiness and peace is life in God’s kingdom. This also establishes your right to ask for help. You are acknowledging that God is your king, and kings are expected to respond to the petitions of their subjects, non-subjects not so much. If you have not seen much happen when you talk to God, maybe you have not established that he is your Father and king.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">As for the second part, notice that the pronoun is ‘us’ not ‘me.’&nbsp; We should show our concern for each other in our prayers. Notice, also, that the issue of sin and forgiveness gets more weight than our physical needs. Food is necessary, but sin blocks our communication with God which blocks His blessing:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">If I had enjoyed having sin in my heart,</span><br>
<span data-contrast=""none"">the Lord would not have listened.</span><br>
<b><span data-contrast=""none"">19 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">But God has surely listened.</span><br>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">As Valentine’s Day draws near, we are reminded how love is the driving force that elevates the ordinary into the remarkable, particularly in the healthcare fields you are preparing for. In healthcare, love is more than just an emotion—it’s an activity, a deep and selfless commitment to humanity in which every patient is more than just a case—each one has a distinct story to tell. Take the time to listen to the story.  Treat every encounter with the warmth of a kind word and the tenderness of a light touch. Let your love shine brightly and let it be the source of inspiration for those around you and a testament to the incredible impact that loving service can have.  We wish you all a very wonderful Valentine’s Day.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Rhea Morallos has been our Controller since this October. In January, she will assume this position full time. Rhea is her nickname and is short for Rhodeliza which is a combination of her parents’ names; her father is Rodolfo and mother is Fideliza. She was born in the Philippines where she graduated from Dela Salle University with a bachelor’s in accountancy, eventually becoming a CPA. After coming to the United States, she got her MBA from the University of Illinois. She previously worked at AUHS in the accounting department in the early years of this university.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Rhea is married with two daughters. She and her husband, Arnold, have been married for 25 years. They have two daughters. Her older daughter, Alisaundre, is in her final year of Law School at Loyola-Chicago. Her undergraduate degree was International Business from the University of Illinois where she received a scholarship to play golf. Rhea’s younger daughter, Annika, is a freshman at Gonzaga, majoring in Biology and rowing on the women’s team. Rhea, herself, enjoys playing golf and watching movies with her husband. She also volunteers at her church, Our Lady of Refuge.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">With respect to the church, she informs us that “My education and family values were molded by the Catholic Christian faith. Our family mantra is to Dream, Achieve and Share – In service to God and in service to others.” These values align with those of AUHS which drew her to work here.&nbsp; Her ultimate dream is “for my daughters to be good citizens of the Lord and continue to share our blessings back to the community.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">As we dream, achieve, and share together, let us shine the spotlight on Rhea Morallos and her dreams and values. God bless you, Rhea!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">You are walking along, and suddenly, your leg gives out from under you. Fortunately, you catch yourself to keep from falling. Then you realize that the leg does not have any feeling. Crawling over to the bed, you realize this is not a momentary loss of balance. As the problem persists, it becomes clear something has happened. But what? Stroke! OK, you think to yourself, what’s next? Using your phone, you Google stroke. It says you need treatment within a 3-hour window to prevent permanent damage.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">At the hospital an hour later (details omitted for brevity), you are given a CT scan to determine whether this is an ischemic (clot-induced) or hemorrhagic stroke. For ischemic stroke, you take TNK (tenecteplase), a genetically modified version of wild-type tPA (tissue plasminogen activator), a clot-dissolving enzyme with a longer half-life and higher fibrin specificity than tPA. Good news — you received the TNK within the 3-hour window. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Over the next three days, you will learn more about stroke and current therapies. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) confirms you have had a stroke and the position of the lesion. Luckily, it is a small and focused region in the parietal lobe of your brain. The neurologist is somewhat excited since he has not seen many lesions like this one. Again, this is good news since the damage is restricted to motor activity and feeling in your right leg and, to a lesser extent, the skin on your upper right body. Your hip, leg, and foot are devoid of feeling.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">By the second day, much of the motor ataxia reverses, and sensation has started to return. An echocardiogram and a transcranial Doppler (TCD) bubble ultrasound indicate some leakage between the auricles of your heart. You learn that 25-30% of people suffer from PFO (patent foramen ovale), where the opening between the left and right atria fails to completely close after birth. The PFO leads to the mixing of venous and arterial blood, allowing the passage of clots from the periphery to the brain. Usually, the lung filters out these clots. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">However, PFO is still only one of several possible ways to deliver a clot to the brain. The other most likely option is for an AFib (atrial fibrillation) to cause a clot to form in the heart and go directly to the brain. Two additional tests help distinguish between stroke resulting from PFO and AFib. An ultrasound camera is inserted into the esophagus near the heart to define the PFO by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The second piece of diagnostic evidence is to wear an outpatient heart monitor for an extended period to assess the frequency of AFibs. Since the PFO also has an associated aneurysm (an atrial septal aneurysm, ASA), you learn that you are at high risk for stroke. The cardiologist, hematologist, and neurologist argue that Eliquist</span><span data-contrast=""none"">®</span><span data-contrast=""none""> (apixaban), a reversible inhibitor of factor Xa, is the best therapeutic approach to reduce the risk of another stroke. However, Eliquist</span><span data-contrast=""none"">®</span><span data-contrast=""none""> is much more expensive than aspirin and produces a greater risk of excessive bleeding if injured.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The American Psychological Association, or APA, is a genuine lifesaver when it comes to written academic formatting. As a former history major, I am aware of how difficult reading used to be before standards for writing were set.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">If you wish to be taken seriously or pass your class, being able to produce well-written papers is a must. It is for this reason that I try to hold APA Review Sessions each quarter. Additionally, professors require you to adhere to the APA format when writing, so this affects your grade as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Another great APA source can also be found on EBSCO. There is a link to the APA Style Guide at the bottom of the list of resources which I highly recommend. It offers guides to things such as paper formatting, in-text citations, and mechanics of style. Or you could just go to the APA File in the Library section of Canvas and look at my PowerPoint. It’s important to do what works for you.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Jessica was drawn to AUHS because of our values, diversity, inclusivity, and the opportunity to surrender to and strengthen her faith in God: “In the short time that I have been with AUHS, I’ve learned that God makes no mistakes and I have no doubt in my mind that God led me here with a purpose.

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Outside of AUHS, she is passionate about learning about different cultures and visiting different parts of the world. She has had the privilege to travel to South America, Mexico, Southeast Asia, Europe, and Iceland and has probably traveled more outside the United States than within the states. She enjoys practicing hot yoga, beach walks with her dog, distance running and spending quality time with her favorite people. This past weekend, she and her family helped with the Acts of Love event for Thanksgiving where AUHS gives back to the community.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:0}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

 Salt and Light: The Glorious Goodness of God ,https://news.auhs.edu/salt-and-light-the-glorious-goodness-of-god/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>Salt and Light: The Glorious Goodness of God&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Brent Davis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Yesterday, I went to my son’s church where the pastor preached on Exodus. One of the main points was the glory of God. In Exodus 33, Moses asks to see God’s glory. God answers his prayer, but interestingly God says He will make all His “goodness” pass before Moses.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In reflecting on why people have little or no faith in God, I believe it is because they have not experienced the glorious goodness of God. Like Moses, Paul also had a profound experience of God on the road to Damascus and a time when he was caught up into heaven. My experiences have not been to those levels, but there have been some moments—as well as many gracious provisions for my daily needs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">During the Thanksgiving and Advent seasons, we consider how the Christian values of love, compassion, and selflessness are reflected in the act of giving.   This spirit of generosity goes beyond material gifts and encompasses time, knowledge, and support.  Let us cultivate a community in which the welfare of others is a living manifestation of the principles that unite us and where everyone is encouraged.  As Christmas draws near, we hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving and Advent season.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This is a season of generosity as President Ryan reminded us. We are beginning Advent when God generously sent His only Son to live among us and we beheld His glory (John 1: 14). We should also be thankful for the gift of health as Dr. Schloss recently discovered. We are thankful for our amazing students who are winning awards and competing at the highest levels with other universities. Finally, we are thankful for our alumni and staff who give of themselves to support our mission and values.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched an invasion of Israel. I want to share a few thoughts on the history of this conflict. Yom Kippur 2023 was not just any Jewish holiday. It was the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Israel by Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries (the Yom Kippur War). The October 7th attack corresponds with Simchat Torah, a holiday celebrating the completion of the annual cycle of public Torah reading and the beginning of a new progression. Simchat Torah means ‘Joy of Torah,’ or happiness that comes from the study of the first five books of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The attacks on Jewish holy days are not accidents. They are a fundamental part of the conflict and an expressed hatred for all things Judeo-Christian. This hatred goes back many years, but for the Middle East has firm roots in the First and Second World Wars. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Amin al-Husseini, was a fervent anti-Zionist. He spent World War II in Germany as Hitler’s guest during political exile from Palestine. Had Germany won the war, he planned to return to Palestine and build crematoriums to incinerate the Palestinian Jews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When England prevailed in WWII, the Jewish state became a reality partly due to Chaim Adriel Weizmann. Weizmann was a Russian-born biochemist who developed an industrial fermentation method for producing acetone, essential for making cordite explosive propellants for the British during World War I. Weizmann’s contribution to the British war effort was crucial for obtaining the Balfour Declaration and gaining recognition for the newly formed State of Israel. The formation of Israel is central to contemporary conflicts.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">For those who hope to reconcile differences between the Torah, Tanakh (Miqrah), Bible (Old and New Testament), and Qur’an, this is impossible. While the Torah (Book of Moses), Tanakh, and Bible share the same origin, the Qur’an claims to be the direct words of God without human corruption. For those who believe the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse in the Roman Catholic Bible), the conflict over Israel will have a somewhat different outcome than for those who follow the Qur’an.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">But what is the origin of the conflict between Jews and Arabs? It is biblical in origin and starts with Sarah’s disobedience and distrust of God’s promise to Abraham. When Sarah bade Hagar, the Egyptian, to have a son with Abraham, she lacked trust in God’s promise that she would bear him a son. Abraham’s first son, Ishmael, was blessed by God and gave rise to the Arab people. The prophet Mohammed is a descendant of Ishmael. Abraham’s second son, Isaac, was also blessed by God and gave rise to the Jewish people. King David and Jesus are descendants of Isaac. Followers of the Qur’an believe that God told Abraham to sacrifice Ishmael, future father of the Arabs, as a test of faith. In contrast, followers of the Judeo-Christian tradition believe it was Isaac, future the father of the Jews, that God told Abraham to sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The relationship of Isaac and Ishmael is one of several critical discrepancies between the two traditions. Followers of the Qur’an believe that Jews altered the Judeo-Christian bible on the importance of Ishmael and other vital points. They believe that the Qur’an contains the direct words of God dictated to the prophet Mohammed by the archangel Gabriel. As such, the Qur’an must have the absolute truth unaltered by human intervention. The Qur’an is one of the finest works of Arabic literature (poetry). However, critics of the Qur’an’s divine origin point out that many sections reflect earlier scriptures. They believe the author(s)/scribes of the Qur’an included and revised earlier religious texts omitted from the canon of the Christian bible as too Gnostic. A significant difference between the Qur’an and the Christian Bible is the crucifixion of Jesus. In the Qur’an, Jesus is not crucified. Someone else, a double, takes Jesus’ place on the cross. A fundamental tenet of Christianity is at odds with the Qur’an.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

 Asking for Help – Salt and Light Campus Ministry  ,https://news.auhs.edu/asking-for-help-salt-and-light-campus-ministry/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>Asking for Help&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>Salt and Light Campus Ministry&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Brent Davis, Ministry Coordinator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">“Please, pray for me.” Almost every week, one or more students ask me to pray for them, which I am always very glad to do. I also look at my own workload and realize I need help! In his book, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">, </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">i</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> Ken Blanchard states that the third trick of self leadership is being proactive, finding resources and asking for help. He also says that we go through four stages in mastering a skill (which are similar to the stages of culture shock, BTW) and which I have simplified here: high motivation and low competence, low motivation and low competence, low motivation and high competence, and high motivation and high competence. This developmental view should be combined with Patrick Lencioni’s six types of working genius</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">ii</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> which reflects the fact that we tend to be more gifted in some areas than others and that working for an extended period of time in an area that is not our gift also leads to low motivation. When our motivation is down, we need to ask for support. When our competence is low, we need to ask for direction. In the case of a recent student, the issue seemed to be more competence. When I asked the student what specifically she wanted prayer for, it was for better grades. So, I asked one of the professors what seemed to be the root cause of poor performance on tests, and she thought it was related to poor study skills, definitely a competence issue. If you are not sure where we are going with this example, the point is to understand that often God answers our prayers by giving either direction or support </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">through</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> another believer, like Barnabas (Acts 13) whose name literally means ‘encouragement.’ Sometimes, as in the case of Elijah, He sends an Elisha to take over some of our work which is the answer I am looking for (not a total transfer—just to hand off some of my responsibilities).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Back to our example of a possible answer to prayer for our student, another issue the professor noted is ‘applying knowledge to new contexts.’ So, what direction could we give to our student? When the student studies she needs to ask: “What will I be asked to </span><b><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">do</span></i></b><span data-contrast=""auto""> on a test?” Now, we know from the professor that there will be application questions. In general, many tests are designed to elicit information related to course outcomes, and those in turn are often formulated using Bloom’s taxonomy. So, by looking at typical application questions connected with Bloom’s taxonomy a student can test him or herself before the test.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Bloom’s taxonomy: Application questions </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">iii</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Apply an abstract idea in a concrete situation to solve a problem or relate it to prior experience. The teacher should: • Provide opportunities for the student to use ideas, theories, or problem-solving techniques and apply them to new situations. • Review the student’s work to ensure that he/she is using problem solving techniques independently. • Provide questions that require the student to define and solve problems. Questioning prompts: What actions would you take to perform _________________? How would you develop _____________ to present _______________?&nbsp; What would the result be if ________________? How would you demonstrate ____________________? How would you present _________________? How would you change _________________? How would you modify _____________?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Of course, an application question requires that some parameters or situational information be given as well. There is, of course, a lot more that could&nbsp; be said about study techniques.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">James writes, “</span><span data-contrast=""none"">If any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. He will give it to you. God gives freely to everyone and doesn’t find fault” (James 1: 5). We need wisdom (or direction), we need support or encouragement. Sometimes we need someone to carry our heavy burdens (Galatians 6: 2). In Salt and Light we are building a community that God can use to answer prayer. Just ask!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Shey Antido has been a professor in our School of Nursing since April 1 (no fooling). Like many of our faculty, she was attracted to AUHS because of our Christian values.&nbsp; These are values that she received from her family growing up in the Philippines. These are values that inform her work and that she is passing on to her three boys along with her very supportive husband. Along the way she received an excellent education and has earned numerous degrees and certifications including her doctorate in nursing practice.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">I aspire to continue providing the best quality of education for all my students. I think that by far the greatest contribution to science has come from my years of health care experience. I am excited to enter the field of research, and I am hopeful that opportunities will arise, and I will work hard to be the best at all I do. I have been a consultant for Howard University HIV National Integration Project (H-NIP) that implemented the National HIV Curriculum (NHC) e-Learning Platform into training and education curricula NHC of the graduating FNP students. I am one of the lead collaborator/facilitators of the Philippine Nurses Association of Southern California, a nonprofit group that has partnered with the University of California Irvine (UCI) in their ongoing UCI Mind Ahead research that conducts a study on the increasing number of Filipinos who are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The study will aim to reach out to this minority group to see how pharmacologic intervention can prevent them from developing Alzheimer’s disease. I think that my intense interest in conducting research and developing improvement projects to support the rising demand and concerns in the health care industry will make me more determined to pursue this endeavor.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Pledge: During the ceremony, students may recite the oath of a pharmacist or the pledge of professionalism, thus affirming their commitment to uphold the ethical and professional standards of pharmacy practice.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As we embark on another term at school, it is important for us to find our inspiration and enthusiasm by reflecting on our hope.  Hope has great power.

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Dr. Le has a PhD in Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology from Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. Her research interests include reproduction and oncology. Her work was centered around biocomplexity and how our immune system communicates with our microbiome, as well as how these interactions affect female reproductive disorders such as endometriosis and preterm birth. She wants to continue her focus on using molecular biology techniques in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between the immune system and mucosal microbial dynamics. Her vision is to focus on her work and her family.

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">28 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches. </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">29 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Who is weak without my feeling that weakness?

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">David had similar feelings of being overwhelmed: </span><span data-contrast=""none"">I cried out, “I am slipping!” but your unfailing love, O </span><span data-contrast=""none"">Lord</span><span data-contrast=""none"">, supported me. When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer” (Psa 94: 18-19, NLT).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Some of you may feel you are slipping as you work hard and long. Are you being supported by God’s unfailing love? Sometimes we just need that reminder, but sometimes we need to do a root cause analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; When things are not going well, there are just a few possibilities: 1) disobedience, 2) spiritual warfare/testing, 3) the consequences of living in a fallen world. In any case, if we turn to Jesus, we will find He is right there with the support we need whatever the cause.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">To deal with disobedience we need to confess our sin(s) and repent. Confession says, ‘I disobeyed.’ Repentance says that we want to change and not disobey again. This can be done just by praying to God, but a supportive friend or small group will help us to follow through on the repentance. It is also helpful to identify the lie that Satan used to tempt us and then identify the scriptural truth that refutes it (and align our thoughts to the truth not the lie). Jesus used this technique in Matthew 4. A blanket verse that I use to deal with temptation is Philippians 4: 19: </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">“</span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">And this same God who takes care of me will supply </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">all your needs</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus” (my italics). If you are not sure whether disobedience is the issue, just ask God to reveal any sin in your life.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Spiritual warfare or testing can be the result of obedience. Satan has some ability to give us grief for obeying God. Job experienced that firsthand. Isaiah tells us:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The high and lofty one who lives in eternity, the Holy One, says this: “I live in the high and holy place with those whose spirits are contrite and humble. I restore the </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">crushed</span></b><span data-contrast=""none""> spirit of the humble and revive the courage of those with repentant hearts. (Isaiah 57: 15)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">This verse shows that whether we are dealing with sin or trials, an attitude of humility is important. Tough times do not last, but tough people do (Robert Schuller). We become tough (perseverance) by responding to difficulties in the strength of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5, Romans 4, 2 Peter 1). Often the Holy Spirit works through others who encourage us and pray for us.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">This also is the key to surviving daily struggles which are just the result of living in a fallen world. When Adam sinned, he had to leave Paradise and work hard to survive. Whatever your struggles, Salt and Light is here to support and strengthen you. Have a restful Labor Day!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

I lived with my maternal grandparents while my parents worked here in the US. For as long as I can remember, my grandfather instilled in all of us the act of service, especially to those who are in dire need.  “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. ‘ (Matthew 25:40)&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></li>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">I worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant in a long-term care facility before applying to a nursing program. Many of the geriatric patients there were grateful for my assistance. They would reminisce about the times when they were independent to do anything they wanted. Many times, I wondered if this is the sort of service my grandfather told us about. I decided that I need to know more and expand my knowledge in the nursing field. In the process of applying to a nursing school to attend, it was my mother who suggested I inquire about the nursing program at AUHS. She mentioned that she came across a flyer years ago, although, at that time, she didn’t look more into it. Despite getting accepted at Mount St. Mary’s University, there was something at AUHS that I believed God had planned for me. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:1440,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The University seeks to impress upon all its graduates the higher mission and noble privilege of community service and improving the quality of healthcare through both provision of care and scholarly study of the impact of that care.” Every volunteer experience–Lamp Unto My Feet, Acts of Love, Santa Cause–reminded me of my grandfather and the principles he instilled in me since I was little.

This month, I would like to follow up with that by talking about our focus in the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; Our ministry, Salt and Light, is based on the parables from the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus where He explains what life is like in the Kingdom of God, which is in one sense all creation, but more especially the realm where people are gathered under God’s rule. In practice this gathering means the church or a group like our campus ministry because relationships are at the heart of Christianity, not rituals or traditions (Romans 14).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">On July 11, I gave a keynote address at the 9</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">th</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> London International Conference online. The subject of the address was “Building Resilience,” a topic that was motivated by the recent pandemic and my work on the future university for the homeless. The work of this university will be to restore the marginalized to professions that will enable them to thrive in today’s economy, but this means dealing with the factors that led to their marginalized condition. This article is adapted from my address.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Systems are characterized by interdependent parts with feedback loops that sometimes work counter intuitively. However, this does not mean that everything is deterministic. For example, the DNA sequence in a gene is not determined by chemical laws although it is made up of molecules. Similarly, although the phonemes of speech are dependent upon physiological processes their sequences are determined by culture. Resilience needs to be addressed at every level to ensure a healthy system.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Thus, resilience comes from healthy lifestyle choices, supportive relationships, and risk management. The book of Ecclesiastes addresses many of these issues. It tells us that meaning and purpose come from depending on God (Ecc. ch. 12), to enjoy your food, rest, and work (ch. 5), and to diversify your investments of time and money (ch. 11). Of all these, the most important is to depend on God for resilience.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

During my PhD-related experimental work at the University of Montreal I recognized that simple chemicals, like propionitrile &amp; cysteamine produce rapidly developing perforated DU in rats &amp; mice. Time-sequence studies with these chemicals allowed us to detect early biochemical alterations not only in the gastric &amp; duodenal mucosa, but also in certain brain areas &amp; adrenal glands. Our structure-activity studies with derivatives of cysteamine &amp; propionitrile revealed that the duodenal ulcerogenic potency of these chemicals depends on having nucleophilic radicals (e.g., -SH, -CN) on 2-carbon backbones. Thus, replacing -SH on the 2-carbon cysteamine with -OH (i.e., ethanolamine H2N-CH2-CH2-OH) results in total loss of DU potency.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-720,&quot;335559737&quot;:-810,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:239}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Yet, these studies did not explain why the lesions develop only in the duodenum, not in other organs, even after systemic (p.o. or s.c) administration of cysteamine. It was Dr. T. Khomenko, one of my creative coworkers who reminded us about the high concentration of iron (Fe) in the duodenal mucosa that provided the first rational explanation of the highly specific localization of cell &amp; tissue injury in the duodenum. Namely, organ distribution studies with radioactive cysteamine showed very high concertation of cysteamine in the duodenum, where interactions with high levels of endogenous iron created a ‘perfect storm’ via the Fenton reaction when reactive the reactive oxygen-derived free radicals initiated a very rapidly developing cell &amp; tissue injury that was partially prevented by antioxidants such superoxide dismutase. The most recent breakthrough for the explanation of cysteamine-induced DU is emerging from the experiments of Dr. J. Schloss who recognized the same molecular/structural specificity for certain enzymes that is identical with the </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">in vivo</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> DU potency of cysteamine vs. ethanolamine.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-720,&quot;335559737&quot;:-810,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:239}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">Mesenteric Fat: Recent data and perspectives for study.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><span data-contrast=""none"">Oksana Zayachkivska, MD, PhD, DSc</span></p>
<p>In modern times, the prevalence of metabolic disorders in the world has pandemic levels. Among them, obesity has similarly faced an upward trend, with the older population showing more susceptibility to obesity and related disorders than younger adults. One interpretation of the ability of adipose tissue to reprogram whole-body physiology is their mitochondria which integrate several processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis, and free radical generation that could cause metabolic signals for obesity and vascular disorders. Mesenteric fat after 28-days hypercaloric diet could be source of systemic changes in cytoprotection. &nbsp;Our translational study has showed that using H2S signaling enrichment will help decrease mesenteric low-grade inflammation, inhibit of leucocyte-endothelial adhesion, mitochondrial dynamics in cell homeostasis, and keep redox balance. It could be implemented as a novel therapeutic strategy for decreased mesenteric visceral “cytotoxicity”.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">The potential role of thiol dioxygenases in GI injury and carcinogenesis:&nbsp; New studies with cysteamine and its derivatives</p>

<p>The <strong><em>molecular mechanism</em></strong> of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers and the effect of cysteamine on pancreatic cancer cells was addressed.&nbsp; Cysteamine was one of the first substances shown to produce perforating duodenal ulcers in a classic study by Selye and Szabo.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; Cysteamine has also been proposed as an adjunct therapy for pancreatic cancer based on its prevention of metastases in an animal model.<sup>2,3</sup>&nbsp; It was shown that both effects are likely mediated by the enzyme cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) based on (1) the differential effects of cysteamine and cysteine on ADO, (2) molecular modeling studies of the ADO enzyme, and (3) the inhibition of cell migration and cysteamine cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cells in culture.&nbsp; Cysteamine, but not cysteine, can reduce O<sub>2</sub>-oxidized ADO, producing cytotoxic superoxide in higher oxygen environments encountered by metastasizing cancer cells.&nbsp; This differential effect of cysteamine and cysteine can be readily explained based on molecular modeling studies conducted with mouse and human ADO crystal structures.&nbsp; Both cysteamine and cysteine inhibit the migration of pancreatic cancer cells in culture, but cysteamine and cysteine have different cytotoxic effects.&nbsp; Cysteamine increases the rate of cell death, but reduces the accumulation of apoptotic cells, while cysteine does not increase the population of dead cells, but does increase the accumulation of apoptotic cells relative to control cultures, based on Sytox Green and flow cytometry-Annexin V analyses.&nbsp; These results suggest that the role of iron in cysteamine mediated duodenal ulcers (Szabo abstract presented in the same meeting) is not due to free iron (classical ferroptosis), but to ADO-bound ferrous iron.&nbsp; ADO is likely inducible by cysteamine in both duodenal and pancreatic cancer cells.&nbsp; For pancreatic cancer cells this is consistent with the role ADO has in Coenzyme A degradation during the metabolic shift from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis in transformed cells.</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Dr. Tiffany Nguyen is a recent and welcome addition to our School of Pharmacy. She comes from a small family, her biological father, stepmother, and younger brother. Dr. Nguyen was raised in nearby Orange County. Though her father may not be a man of many words, she learned so much from him about approach, respect, integrity, and humility through his actions, and considers him to be her greatest inspiration and role model in life.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Now, she is excited to start a new journey in academia at AUHS since she had previously taken on several tutoring and mentorship roles at different stages of her life—in high school, both undergrad and grad school, and as a pharmacist. She genuinely cares about preparing students to become the best versions of themselves–not only as professionals, but also as individuals and members of the community. She hopes to instill confidence, leadership, professionalism, and humility in future generations of pharmacists.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Outside of work, Dr. Nguyen recently has found a new passion for Pilates and loves to be in nature or to travel—believing that both experiences bring perspective and humble you. In the words of Anthony Bourdain: “It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I still have to go, the more there is to learn. Maybe that’s enlightenment enough; to know that there is no final resting place of the mind; no smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom is realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

I don’t have any pets, but eventually, I want to have a Golden Doodle. I used to play volleyball for Los Angeles Harbor College and Phineas Banning High School. On my free time or days off, I go to the gym to work out and sometimes go to the beach for a run. My advice for current and prospective students is to do your best to stay on track and review your key concepts early on so that you do not forget the basics of nursing. Also, don’t be overwhelmed when you see NGN questions. If anything, it is good to start looking at these case scenario questions now so that you can be more comfortable answering them when NGN comes up on your tests.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Songs and hymns sometimes sum up our most important beliefs and values. If you were to pick a song that encapsulated Christianity, what would it be? Amazing Grace? Absolutely amazing, but is grace the goal of a Christian or the means? Clearly the means—to what? Sometimes it helps to look at the conclusion to find the main idea of a document. What do we find at the end of the Bible? </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">3 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">I heard a loud shout from the throne, saying, “Look, God’s home is now among his people!

To be together, we need to be Jesus’s disciples, obeying His commands and serving one another: ““All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them” (John 14: 23). A few verses later Jesus declares:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">In Salt and Light, we are not just trying to teach you good values and ways to be a better person, we are seeking to love you in the way Christ loves us.

For all these reasons, I think the hymn that sums up what Christianity is all about is “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As I thought about a word from God for our students, I reflected on the stress caused by the end of the term, especially final exams. Isaiah has some great words for people in stressful situations. Chapter 26, verse 3 came to my mind, and I trust you will find it as encouraging as I have. In this passage the people of God were feeling threatened by enemies, but Isaiah likens God’s salvation to strong walls. Trusting in God gives us peace. The word for peace in Hebrew is ‘shalom’ and ‘perfect peace’ is ‘shalom shalom.’ As you face the issues that give you stress, trust in God’s salvation and experience ‘shalom shalom.’</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">For Global Nurses Week (May 11 -12, 2023) an international conference entitled “Doctors and Nurses on The Frontline Of Health Care In Ukraine And Globally” was held in Lutsk, Ukraine. One of the main organizers was The Shevchenko Scientific Society which for over 150 years has been the premier (and oldest) Ukrainian scientific society devoted to the promotion of scholarly research and publication. Together with Dr. Oksana Zayachkivska, who is a Professor of Physiology here at AUHS we presented at this conference. Our presentation was on “Interprofessional Communication in Healthcare: The 5R Method” based on the three years’ experience in implementing interprofessional education here at AUHS.&nbsp;&nbsp; We shared many of the techniques and concepts that we use at AUHS for Interprofessional education, including for nursing, pharmacists, and the School of Medicine. The key ingredients are focusing on communication skills, using a multidisciplinary approach, and mutual respect amongst healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">By Valeria Adimkpayah, Pharmacist Intern</p>
<p>The American University of Health Sciences School of Pharmacy continues to promote and enhance the learning opportunities of students who embark on their Doctor of Pharmacy degree. For students navigating towards the end of their academic training at the school of pharmacy, pharmacy interns are prepared to tackle more challenging professional careers which, numerous pharmacy organizations have rallied to promote throughout the years.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left""><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19985"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1171"" height=""878"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5.jpg 1171w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-768x576.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1171px) 100vw, 1171px""></a><br>
The American Society of Health- System Pharmacist (ASHP) which was established in 1942, over the years has transformed the definition of service provided to patients in all medical and non-medical settings. ASHP set a standard to motivate pharmacy interns into pursuing a more directive, distinct and advanced training to equip prospective candidates to embrace various career enhancement opportunities. ASHP proposed a standard for various established programs that intend to register their residency programs so as to gain accreditation and certify institutional training bodies eligible to advertise, interview, match, and enroll successful candidates into pharmacy residency programs. ASHP is governed by detailed rules for both participating programs and prospective candidates to adhere to while identifying prospective candidates.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">The ASHP residency program has proven to strengthen students with strong backgrounds in hospital and health systems, ambulatory service, managed care, acute care/general medicine, critical care, oncology, long-term care, leadership, and more.<br>
Essentially, candidates are generally final year students, are completing their pharmacy education, or have completed their pharmacy education and passed their respective licensing exams.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left"">Cohort 2, the second pharmacy class of the School of Pharmacy participated in the 2023 ASHP match and 100% of the applicants who completed the process were successful in matching into respective programs at the end of the phase I and II match process. The accomplishment of the students who participated in the matching process is highly recognized by the School of Pharmacy and is celebrated, which encourages more students to strive towards taking on the challenge and seeking to take more career advancement opportunities.</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Stress is the nonspecific response of the body to any demand made upon it, as defined by Hans Selye more than 80 years ago, based on his animal experiments at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. By emphasizing ‘nonspecificity’ he tried to underline that stress response is elicited my several factors, like nowadays in COVID-19, e.g., fear of infection, social isolation, death in family, loss of employment, etc. Thus, COVID-19 has been the largest new human stressor in the twenty-first century. Selye’s studies in rats also revealed 3 stages of stress response: the short initial “alarm reaction” is followed by a longer “stage of resistance”, associated with increased levels of corticosterone that is often terminated by a “stage of exhaustion”, referring to an exhausted adrenal cortex when the secretion of glucocorticoids drops. Fast forward, that is exactly what has been documented in severe cases of infections caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus: in hospitalized COVID-19 patients initially the blood levels of cortisol not only have been elevated, but only those with high concentration of this natural anti-inflammatory corticosteroid survived vs. those who had low levels of cortisol, suggesting diminished adrenocortical functions. Furthermore, patients with very severe cases of COVID-19 who ended up in intensive care units had significantly low cortisol blood levels, compared to patients with equal severity of diseases due to other causes. Thus, these ‘natural phenomena’ in clinical medicine, unfortunately confirmed Selye’s studies in experimental animals several decades ago. Still, the good news is that astute clinicians empirically recognized this and started to give potent synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone to severe COVD-19 patients and this beneficial effect of exogenous corticoids has been extensively confirmed in the scientific literature.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:600,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

As you read through the articles and stories, you will see some of the first fruits of our focus on interprofessional education and research on COVID-19, the influence of AUHS’s core values based on God’s word in the lives of our new School of Nursing dean and a recent graduate, and give glory to God for the achievements by our students and faculty at conferences around the world by His grace and the power of the Holy Spirit.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Dr. Michelle Paysan-Modina is our new Executive Dean and Professor of the School of Nursing and Assistant Chief Nurse Administrator of AUHS. Dr. Paysan-Modina was born in the Philippines and is the youngest of five children. She comes from a close-knit family who love to get together, eat together, and pray together.

Her parents always served in their church, made visits to the sick, helped the poor, and served as community leaders in the neighborhood. They emphasized the importance of giving back to the community.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The AUHS mission and philosophy were instrumental in her decision to join the university family: “They do not just make a statement about it, but back it up with action.” Also, out supportive and inspirational owners, Pastor Gregory and Ms. Kim, as well as our academic leaders, Drs. Ryan and Uvero attracted her.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Her other interests are doing yoga every day and a love of travel—to see the world. Currently, she is serving as the President of the Philippine Nurses Association of CA in Orange County and looks forward to collaborating with the AUHS Foundation for community outreach. Her research interests are servant leadership, DEI, mentorship, community health and wellness, and breast cancer screening and early detection.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">I was born in Iraq, raised in Syria, and immigrated to the United States in 2001. Since then, I have resided in Orange County. From a young age, I recognized my true calling to be of service to others, and it has brought me immense joy to bring happiness to those around me. Additionally, I have always been fascinated by the human body and possessed an innate curiosity to comprehend it. These factors led me to pursue a career in nursing, driven by my desire to assist those in need. During my exploration of various nursing schools, I was particularly drawn to AUHS due to its Christian values, despite my own Muslim faith. The interview experience left me with a profound sense of connection and assurance, prompting me to choose AUHS. Looking back, it has been the best decision I have made, and I felt a sense of divine guidance leading me towards this path.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

This has always been a passion of mine. Initially, I worked as a medical surgical/tele RN, which equipped me with the necessary nursing skills. However, my true passion has always been centered around providing care for the homeless population, individuals with mental illnesses, and geriatric patients.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Furthermore, I am currently pursuing my FNP at AUHS and will be graduating in June. I would like to offer some advice to current students: remain focused, stay consistent, and maintain a prayerful mindset. With dedication and a determined heart and mind, guided by the presence of God, there are no limits to what you can achieve. Before you know it, you will have completed your studies and be ready to embark on the next step, such as an MSN-DNP program.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">In addition to my current roles, I am also a teacher’s assistant at AUHS, where I assist BSN students with their nursing skills.

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Looking ahead, my long-term future goal is to own a nursing facility. I aspire to create a space where individuals can receive high-quality care and support in a compassionate and nurturing environment. I believe that through ownership of a nursing facility, I can make a significant impact on the lives of those in need, providing them with the best possible care and improving their overall well-being.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The first study by Bin Deng with coinvestigators Ann Chung, Elaine Nguyen, Shankar Gollapudi and Transon Nguyen set out to study “Medication Adherence in a Homeless Population in Long Beach, CA.” The understanding is that chronic diseases require medication adherence for the treatment to be successful; medication nonadherence is very common. Medication nonadherence is defined as the extent to which a person’s behavior does not coincide with medical or health advice. This leads to poor health outcomes, admission to emergency rooms and overall increases in physician visits causing an increase in overall health care. At this point the IRB is requesting a final report of this study that was completed recently.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The second aim of the study is to investigate the association of thrombocytopenia in the ICU patients with the use of piperacillin-tazobactam and/or different anticoagulants. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity encompassing most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. One of the potential side effects of piperacillin-tazobactam is thrombocytopenia (low number of platelets in the blood) and this can increase the risk of bleeding. This observation is also common amongst ICU patients.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The AUHS School of Pharmacy’s student chapter, APhA-ASP/CPhA, is proud to share that they have successfully hosted their very first Spring Banquet &amp; Board Installment on Friday, April 7th, 2023! During this momentous occasion, students from each cohort joined together in celebration to recognize the efforts and participation of their student members’ achievements.

 Famous Women Scientists and Nobel Laureates from the Second Part of the 20th Century,https://news.auhs.edu/19908-2/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3.png,Articles,"<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>Famous Women Scientists and Nobel Laureates From the Second Part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>By Sandor Szabo, MD, PhD, MPH,&nbsp;Founding Dean and Professor, School of Medicine</strong></p>
<p>As we celebrate March being the ‘History of Women’, it’s worth recalling the most outstanding female biomedical scientists who received the highest decorations and most prestigious awards in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>One is Rosalyn Yalow, PhD who was a “pioneer in nuclear medicine” who received the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1977, “for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones” (1, 2), along with Drs. Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally who worked feverishly on the isolation of hypothalamic releasing hormones. The Nobel website (2) briefly summarizes her personal &amp; professional life: “Rosalyn Yalow was a stubborn and single-minded child. Her parents wanted her to become a schoolmistress, but instead they became a physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Rosalyn Yalow grew up in and lived almost her entire life in New York. Her parents came from humble backgrounds, but that did not stop Rosalyn and her brother, Alexander, from striving for something greater. Rosalyn began to read before she began preschool. Her 7th-grade chemistry teacher aroused her interest in science, and when at university, she took a liking to nuclear physics… Rosalyn Yalow was a nuclear physicist. She developed radioimmunoassay (RIA) together with Dr. Solomon Berson. RIA is used to measure small concentrations of substances in the body, such as hormones in the blood. Yalow and Berson tracked insulin by injecting radioactive iodine into patients’ blood. Because the method is so precise, they were able to prove that type 2 diabetes is caused by the body’s inefficient use of insulin. Previously it was thought that the disease was caused by a lack of insulin.” Unfortunately, Dr. Berson died before he could get the Nobel prize. Dr. Yalow was a very modest woman, who worked almost exclusively at the VA Medical Center in Bronx, NY, and in that capacity (since I also spent 20 years in the VA system), I had the pleasure of meeting her once, in part because we also used several RIA methods to measure the concentration of many hormones that have large-enough molecules to develop antibodies against them.</p>
<p><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19909"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1.png"" alt="""" width=""352"" height=""320"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1.png 352w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1-300x273.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px""></a></p>
<p>The other famous woman, also Nobel laureate is Rita Levi-Montalcini, MD. Namely, the 1986 Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology was shared by Rita Levi-Montalcini and Stanley Cohen for “discoveries of fundamental importance in understanding the mechanisms that regulate the growth of cells and organs” (4). &nbsp;She was born in 1909, in Turin, Italy. Her mother was an artist, and her father was an electrical engineer. Rita added her mother’s name (Montalcini) to her surname (Levi) when she began her professional career. In 1936, Levi-Montalcini received her MD degree from the University of Turin, and in 1940, she received a degree for specialization in neurology and psychiatry from the same institution (4). In 1947, Dr. Levi-Montalcini went to Washington University in St Louis, MO, to work with embryologist Viktor Hamburger (1900-2001), who was studying the growth of nerve tissue in chick embryos. In 1948, she and Hamburger identified nerve growth factor (NGF), the first of many cell-growth factors discovered in the bodies of animals. In 1953, American biologist and zoologist Stanley Cohen, PhD joined her at Washington University, and they continued the work on NGF. Dr. Cohen purified NGF, determined its chemical nature, and produced NGF antibodies. He also discovered another growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF) (4).&nbsp; Since EGF also plays a role in ulcer development and protection of gastroduodenal mucosa, he was the keynote speaker at an international conference on the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulceration shortly after he received the Nobel prize and I, among others, spent many hours of productive conversations with Dr. Cohen at that meeting at the beautiful seaside resort in Antalya, Turkey.</p>
<p><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19910"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.png"" alt="""" width=""720"" height=""243"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.png 720w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2-300x101.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></a></p>
<p>The discovery of NGF and EGF opened the field to subsequent discoveries of several peptide growth factors, such as FGF (fibroblast growth factor), PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and VPF/VEGF (vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor). Since these factors, especially FGF, PDGF and VPF/VEGF play a major role in the molecular mechanisms of gastroduodenal ulceration, we investigated these peptides both in biochemical and pharmacologic experiments in my laboratory during the last about 30 years.</p>
<p>Thus, these two famous women were not only creative scientists, but trailblazers to open the door to many female researchers who followed them in the second part 20<sup>th</sup> century and at the beginning of 21<sup>st</sup> century.&nbsp; My research laboratories in Boston and in SoCal also reflected this trend, since I always had an almost equal number male and female coworkers that is reflected in our scientific publications (5-10).</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">It was an unusual encounter when I first met this man. Although I have seen him around my workplace in Anaheim for the past couple of months, I never really had the chance to talk to him up until this point. Occasionally, I would see him walk along the same pavement, carrying what appeared to be a huge blanket over his back. Nevertheless, meet the sweetest man with the biggest heart, “J.” Upon our initial interaction, he seemed to be a very compliant and warm-hearted individual.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-15,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:14,&quot;335559739&quot;:3,&quot;335559740&quot;:476}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">For starters, I introduced myself to “J,” and promptly asked him if he was okay with me interviewing him about his life, how he became homeless, as well as bringing up some questions revolving around health care and the receiving of such. He acknowledged what I was doing was for the sake of a project for class, and gave me consent to interview him. Sitting near a bench in front of a bakery, I gave him the stage to introduce himself. This included answers such as how old he is and where he lives. “I’m 47 years old and I lived in Orange County my entire life. Around 15 years old, my stepdad got a job offer as a receptionist at a hotel, so we ended up moving to the city of Santa Ana so that we were closer to his workplace.” “J,” talked to me about how his parents ended up divorcing at a later point in time because his stepfather ended up cheating on his mother, which led to his mother becoming depressed and in shambles. He also mentioned that his mother neglected him as a result for the next few years, but he still continued to support her, regardless if she didn’t love him. “Why did you continue to care for your mother if she was not willing to support you?” I asked “J.” He responded, “I was always taught to respect my mother. She was the one who gave me the most gracious gift in the world, and that was life. I don’t regret living because my mom brought me into this world, so I wanted to do the best for her – give her the best, you know?” Because of this love, he stayed with his mom while working part-time at a local McDonald’s to keep the roof over their heads. “J” also brought up the fact that he dropped out of high school to take care of his mom. Abruptly, he tells me, “I wish I had done better, though.” “How so?” My heart dropped as “J” explained how his mother passed away through a drug overdose. Giving my condolences, he continued his story that transitions into how he became homeless.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-15,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:14,&quot;335559739&quot;:3,&quot;335559740&quot;:476}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

I’m not sure how this happened, but I later found out that my wife had been cheating on me with my best friend, three years into our marriage.” With my eyes widened and my mouth hanging agape, I let him continue his story. “It’s not easy to live a life where you’re taken for granted. I decided to leave with simply the clothes on my back and started living in my car. I really didn’t have anyone else to go to because the last person I had left, already left me.” This was a form of reality I never thought to expect, but I strived on to further understand his situation. I responded, “That truly is a lot to handle, and I’m sorry you had to go through that. Do you still have that car?” “J” replied, “No, after I used all the money in my wallet for food and gas, I ended up selling the car and continued to use that to buy my necessities. You know, like extra clothes, travel-sized items… essentially, the good stuff. I never went back to the apartment I shared with my ex-wife for obvious reasons.” Things were going well for him until he used up all the money from the car he sold, which took a mere three weeks until he completely had little to nothing in terms of pocket change. For the past 11 years, “J” has been living off the coins and small bills he gains from willing people who cross paths with him in exchange for his heartfelt stories. Some of these stories also come from his experiences with medical care.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-15,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:14,&quot;335559739&quot;:3,&quot;335559740&quot;:476}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">One of the main healthcare challenges “J” had to face was the lack of financial stability; after the loss of his car and using up all his money accumulated from it, “J” would only eat twice or three times a week, had it be for the remaining money in his pocket. Fortunately, he takes advantage of the local soup kitchen in the city of Anaheim, whose primary goal was to provide services that advocate and supplement the quality of life for those who are hungry, as well as for those that are homeless, but depend on their services. The nearest homeless shelter around the area “J” is in is about an hour’s worth of a walk, so he usually sleeps on a bench a block down from my place of work. Sometimes, the security would be out patrolling the area, wake him up, and ask him to leave for “disturbing the peace.” I continued to ask questions involving the grab at health insurance and the overall availability of insurance, to which “J” was able to elaborate, saying that they see him in a negative light.&nbsp; He brings up how he has gone to a place and blatantly kicked him out for no good reason. “J” claims that hospitals are, “unsatisfying for homeless people,” and that, “they don’t have great resources to connect people to,” or that, “building relationships with homeless service organizations have also been pretty hard.” He believes that hospitals could collaborate with more homeless organizations and refer people experiencing homelessness to follow up on health or non-health related needs. “I feel that everyone is entitled to the basic needs in life. Y’know, like food, water, clothing, and shelter… it’s the bare necessities for anyone’s survival.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-15,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:14,&quot;335559739&quot;:3,&quot;335559740&quot;:476}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">We concluded the interview by discussing what advice one would give when a person approaches, or is approached by a homeless person. “J” proceeds to emphasize how empathy is key, and that these individuals are people, too. People that are experiencing homelessness may have little social contact, and would want to tell their story with a purpose in mind. “J” has also advised that there is good that comes from charity, but the value of justice puts the icing on the cake, that the poor did not choose, nor do they deserve, to be poor. Thank you, “J.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:-15,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:14,&quot;335559739&quot;:3,&quot;335559740&quot;:476}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> (Lewis, 1950), the witch tempts Edmund with Turkish delight. Which is quite delightful even when not magical. Recently we observed the International Day of Happiness, and in my media post for the day, I mentioned that one of my favorite verses is Psalm 37: 4 (NLT): “</span><span data-contrast=""none"">Take delight </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">in the Lord, and he will give you your heart’s desires.” Pastor and theologian John Piper (2013) wrote: “We are admiring creatures to the core and I think we are wired to be satisfied by admiring the most admirable and the most admirable is God. Therefore, “delight yourself in the Lord” means delight yourself in seeing his infinite admirableness” (para. 1).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Edwards (edited by Houston, 1996) wrote:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The exercise of true and holy love in the saints come in a very different way. It is not primarily that they first see that God loves them and therefore He is to be loved, but rather that they first see that God Himself is lovely. God appears so glorious and excellent that their hearts are enraptured by Him alone. (p. 93)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Personally, I am still working to get there, and this little article is for my benefit as well. I, too easily, find my delight in Turkish delight, and French fries and science fiction. But, our affections can be molded by God’s grace. Edwards, again: “… a love of divine things because of the beauty and sweetness of their moral excellence is the beginning and source of all holy affections” (p. 97).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">True spiritual and gracious affections are not aroused in this way. They come from the enlightening of the mind in order to understand the things that are taught of God and Christ in a new way. This comes through a new understanding of the excellent nature of God, His wonderful perfections, or from some new view of Christ in His spiritual excellencies and fullness. These are entirely different in character from any ideas or stimuli that come naturally to man.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Some day we will join a mighty of chorus of all created beings delighting in God:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center"">By ​​John V. Schloss, PhD&nbsp; ​</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">For Women’s History Month (March 1-31), I would like to honor the memory of an extraordinary friend and colleague from Huntington, West Virginia, Dr. Ruth Christ Sullivan. Ruth died on September 16, 2021, at 97, leaving behind a remarkable legacy. Before serving in the Army Nurse Corps during World War II, she obtained her nursing degree from Charity Hospital, New Orleans, in 1943. At age 60, she received a Ph.D. in special education, speech pathology, and psychology from Ohio University. Between her education in nursing and her doctoral degree, the birth of her fifth child, Joseph, transformed Ruth’s life into a crusade for autism. Joe Sullivan was diagnosed as autistic at the age of 3 in 1963. At that time, there were many misconceptions about autism. “Refrigerator mothers,” who were cold and distant, received blame for autism. Ruth Sullivan knew this was not the cause of Joe’s problem.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:256}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Together they founded the National Society for Autistic Children, which later became the Autism Society. Ruth’s son Joe was one of several role models for Dustin Hoffman’s character Raymond Babbitt in the movie </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Rain Man</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">. Ruth Sullivan served as a technical advisor for the film. Ruth’s prominence in the field of autism research resulted in her receiving a wealth of anecdotal information on dietary supplements that help improve the symptoms of autistic children. I was fortunate to get to know Dr. Sullivan after joining Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. We were interested in various nutritional supplements and diets’ effects on autistic children. Ruth and I spent working lunches discussing various dietary approaches that might help alleviate the symptoms of different subpopulations of those who have autism. My wife, Marietta, and I were guests in Ruth’s home several times, where we met her son Joe. Although Joe Sullivan was very shy, he did manage to tell Marietta that he liked her almond cookies. Ruth Sullivan was a devoted Catholic. A retired priest from the Woodlands Retirement Community, where my mother also resided, was a frequent guest at her family gatherings. Ruth Sullivan was an inspiring and unforgettable person. Counting her among our Huntington, West Virginia, friends was an honor.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:256}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Multiple nutritional deficiencies (MND) confound studies designed to assess the role of a single nutrient in contributing to the initiation and progression of disease states. Despite the perception of many healthcare practitioners, up to 25% of Americans are deficient in five-or-more essential nutrients. Stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic further increases the prevalence of deficiency states. Viral infections compete for crucial nutrients with immune cells. Viral replication and proliferation of immunocompetent cells critical to the host response require these essential nutrients, including zinc. Clinical studies have linked levels of more than 22 different dietary components to the likelihood of COVID-19 infection and the severity of the disease. People at higher risk of infection due to MND are also more likely to have long-term sequelae, known as Long COVID.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The previous acute respiratory diseases caused by viruses originating from China or the middle east (e.g., SARS, MERS) remained fast developing short diseases without major sequalae or any long-lasting complications. The new COVID-19, on the other hand, not only that it rapidly spread over the world, but some patients never fully recovered or even if they did, a few weeks later started to complain not only of shortness of breath, if any, but general weakness, muscle pains and ‘brain fog’, i.e., fuzzy memories. Thus, these signs and symptoms were eventually labelled ‘long COVID’, for which the most widely used definition is ‘new signs and symptoms occurring 4–8 weeks after recovering from acute stage of COVID-19’. The other most frequent manifestations associated with long COVID include headache, loss of memory, smell and of hair, nausea, and vomiting. Thus, long COVID is not a simple disease, but complex disorder of several organ systems malfunctioning; hence, it is probably more appropriate to call this a syndrome. The pathogenesis of long COVID syndrome is poorly understood,</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">but initial and persistent vascular endothelial injury that often triggers the formation of microthrombi that if dislodged as emboli, damage several organs, especially in the brain, heart, and kidney, by creating microinfarcts. The other major contributory mechanistic factor is the persistent cytokine storm that may last longer in long COVID patients than in others, probably triggered by aggregates of SARS-Co-2 discovered recently in the adrenal cortex, kidney, and brain. The prevalence of long COVID is relatively high, e.g., initially varied 3–30%, and recent data indicate that 2.5% of UK population suffers from this</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">syndrome, while in the US 14.7% of acute COVID-19 patients continued to have symptoms longer than 2 months.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Metabolic physiology plays a key role in maintaining our health and resilience. Metabolic disorders can lead to serious ill-nesses, including obesity. The pathogenesis of the new long COVID syndrome in individuals with long-term recovery after SARS-Co-2 infection is still incomplete. Thus, there is growing attention in the study of adipose tissue activities, especially brown adipose tissue (BAT) and associated resilience which plays a crucial role in different types of obesity as potential targets for pharmacologic and nutritional interventions in the context of obesity and long COVID. The number of studies examining mechanisms underlying BAT has grown rapidly in the last 10 years despite of role of BAT in individuals with COVID-19 and long COVID is modest. Therefore, this review aims to sum up data examining BAT activities, its resilience in health, obesity, and the possible link to long COVID. The search was conducted on studies published in English mostly between 2004 and 2022 in adult humans and animal models. Database searches were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for key terms including adipose tissue, BAT, adipokines, obesity, VPF/VEGF, and pathogenesis. From the initial search through the database were identified relevant articles that met inclusion and exclusion criteria and our data regarding adipose tissues were presented in this review. It will discuss adiposity tissue activities. Current literature suggests that there are BAT integral effects to whitening and browning fat phenomena which reflect the homeostatic metabolic adaptive ability for environmental demand or survival/adaptive mechanisms. We also review neural and vascular impacts in BAT that play a role in resilience and obesity. Finally, we discuss the role of BAT in the context of long COVID in basic</span><br>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This past Friday as I arrived to work in the morning, I saw several people lining up to receive the groceries to be given out the AUHS Foundation starting at 2pm. By 2pm there was over 500 people there including children. Free groceries were given to 435 families, including a whole chicken and bags of rice. The food was supplied by Superior Grocers at a discount. They also set up a booth with popcorn and cotton candy. Ms. Thida Eam, the Foundation Coordinator noted that people were very appreciative, but that, sadly, some people had to be turned away. There were more people showing up this year than last which shows the increased need in the community.&nbsp; The Foundation hopes to raise more funds for next quarter’s event to meet the increased need.

We are delighted that our newest nursing graduates are doing well with their licensing exams. We are touched by the story of “J” an interview by one of our General Education students. We are delighted by the social and professional activities of our pharmacy students, while at the same time being concerned about the effects of long COVID. We have, in fact, three articles from a special issue of the journal <em>Inflammopharmacology</em> edited by our own Drs. Szabo and Zayachkivska on this topic. We are delighted by the story of Ruth Sullivan as we celebrate Women’s History Month while recognizing the challenges faced by those with autism. Finally, we wind up with a spotlight on the delightful Dr. Schloss, (you also do not mess with Dr. Schloss; you will know why when you read the article on Mr. Miyagi)—and a focus on delighting ourselves in God—the <em>most</em> delightful.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In an effort to stem the progression of a disease that affects more than six million Americans, pharmaceutical companies have labored through a long series of unsuccessful clinical trials in the past using amyloid-targeting medications to help treat patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Despite conflicting findings from clinical trials, Biogen’s Aduhelm became the first amyloid-targeting medication to be approved in 2021. Although there was controversy among some experts on the treatment’s safety and effectiveness, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and regulators approved another medication for Alzheimer’s that appears to halt the brain disorder. Lecanemab, a medication that works on the amyloid beta, was the subject of an accelerated FDA approval request from Eisai and Biogen. Lecanemab functions by attaching to and neutralizing amyloid “protofibril” clusters in the brain. The late-stage trial was the most recent to evaluate a thirty-year-old hypothesis that amyloid builds up in Alzheimer patients’ brains and causes the illness, which can be slowed by medications that prevent this protein buildup.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Lecanemab has shown effectiveness at slowing cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical research of 1,795 participants who received the medication or a placebo. In contrast to other amyloid-targeting medications that have failed in significant studies, the drug reduced cognitive decline by 27% in the phase 3 clinical trials when compared to placebo. Over the course of 18 months, participants either received a placebo or a dose of 10 mg per kilogram, every two weeks. People using the medication were more likely to have brain edema and a little bleeding. The cost of Lecanemab, marketed under the trade name Leqembi, for biweekly dosing, is around $26,500 per year. Lecanemab’s approval was decided following some critical congressional reports on the prominent drug, Aduhelm. There are many unanswered clinical questions yet to be concluded with Aduhelm. However, these newer drug approvals will certainly be part of the conversation to help people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and their families.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In the past month, it has become apparent that many health practitioners do not understand the toxicity and pharmacology of acetaminophen (a.k.a. Paracetamol, APAP, Tylenol, and Panadol). When used at low doses, the risk of toxicity from acetaminophen is small. However, at high doses (greater than 4 grams within 24 hours), oxidative metabolic pathways for acetaminophen create a highly toxic metabolite. The metabolic pathways involved in overdose [CYP3A4 at therapeutic concentrations (50 μM) and CYP2E1, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 at overdose (1 mM)]</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>1</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> will convert a substantial fraction of acetaminophen to the glutathione-reactive metabolite </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">N</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>2</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. Glutathione is essential to life. The liver contains the highest glutathione concentration in the body (5 mM). So, for anyone who consumes 4 grams (26 mmol) of acetaminophen in a short period, it is possible to produce enough of the reactive metabolite to destroy ALL of the liver glutathione (7 mmol in the average adult), resulting in permanent liver damage. Although glutathione is present in all tissues and is an abundant molecule (0.5-5 mM), the total body amount in a 75-pound child (14-136 mmol) or a 155-pound adult (28-280 mmol) is low enough to put their lives at risk from consuming relatively small amounts of acetaminophen. Destruction of glutathione by acetaminophen can be fatal.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Aspirin and other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) do not have this type of toxicity. Although aspirin is a reactive molecule and can cause Reye’s syndrome in children due to damage to the mitochondria.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>5</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One question in pharmacy education is, “Why does aspirin increase bleeding risk and prevent blood coagulation, while acetaminophen does not have this pharmacology?”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The answer to this question involves the different mechanisms by which they inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis. The mechanism by which aspirin inactivates the enzyme (enzyme acylation) is independent of intracellular versus extracellular localization. At the same time, potent inhibition of COX by acetaminophen requires cellular integrity since therapeutic levels inhibit the enzyme in intact cells but not in lysed cells.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>6</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> This observation can be explained by the effect of ‘peroxide tone’ on acetaminophen inhibition of COX, the fact that hydroperoxide-generating lipoxygenases lessen the potency of acetaminophen, and the buildup of COX substrates in the periphery to minimize the effectiveness of acetaminophen.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>7</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp; The molecular mechanism of acetaminophen involves quenching an essential radical at tyrosine-385 in the COX active site. The potency of APAP depends on the failure to regenerate this tyrosyl radical, which explains its lack of potency in the periphery, where radical regeneration occurs more rapidly. So, although they both inhibit the same enzyme, aspirin is far more effective than acetaminophen as an anticoagulant. They are both effective for treating pain and fever, but aspirin is a potent anticoagulant, while acetaminophen is not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">February 11 marked the International Day of Women and Girls in Science (from Resolution 70/212 of the 70th session of the UN General Assembly dated December 22, 2015). This year is the 8th time this date will be celebrated. The main goal of the Resolution of the UN General Assembly, which proclaimed February 11 as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, was to eliminate the significant gender gap in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines across the world. Gender equality in education and science are both vital for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">On February 22-24, 2023, we were honored by a visit from Dr. Anna Bekesevych of Lviv National Medical University in Ukraine. She delivered a lecture to the faculty of the School of Medicine on the topic of Anatomy Education. Dr. Bekesevych has a long-standing interest in anatomy which led to her achieving a doctorate in this field, researching the cerebellum. Currently, she teaches first- and second-year medical students. She is very aware of her students’ learning styles and provides the learning activity that will be most appropriate for each student whether drawing, or discussing, or using anatomical software.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Our headlines are filled with stories of trauma and suffering, and we often experience these in our own lives or the lives of loved ones as well.&nbsp; Students have shared with me stories ranging from minor bouts of COVID to family members committing suicide.&nbsp; In my own family, I have had loved ones attempt suicide and nearly lost one in-law to COVID. How can we find healing and build resilience in ourselves and our loved ones to either prevent, mitigate, or be restored to health? By God’s grace we can find answers to this question, but sometimes the answer is wait.&nbsp; The best answer, as a recent article by Russell Moore reminded is—grace.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>i</sup></span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Whenever we address the questions of trauma and suffering, we inevitably face the question of why a good and omnipotent God allows these things to happen. Many theologians have addressed these issues and I can only summarize the most obvious points and direct you to further reading in the notes below.</span><span data-contrast=""auto""><sup>ii</sup></span><span data-contrast=""auto""> First, we must recognize that we live in a fallen world, not the Garden of Eden nor the New Creation where there will be not pain or death. We live in a fallen world because of the sin of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3). In a fallen world, Job loses his family and possessions; a missionary gets gang raped; a pastor and his wife are killed in an earthquake, leaving their daughter an orphan; and my family experienced a home invasion.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">So, we wait and let God’s power work in us. How does God’s grace bring healing and resilience?

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Sarah sat huddled in the corner of her small, dimly lit home, her hands tightly gripping her worn out shawl. Her eyes were closed as she silently prayed for a miracle. She had been suffering from chronic pain for years and had been told by many doctors that there was no cure. She had spent all her savings on doctors and treatments, but none of them had been able to heal her. She had given up hope, until she heard of a man named Jesus who had been healing the sick and performing miracles.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When she had heard that Jesus was in town, she knew she had to see him. Determined to meet him, Sarah made her way through the crowded streets of Capernaum, where Jesus was said to be preaching. As she pushed through the throngs of people, her condition worsened and the people began to mock her saying things like: “she is unclean and should not be here”; “she is wasting her time and money”; but Sarah had faith and was determined to keep going.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">With her last bit of strength, she made her way to the crowd that had gathered around him. Her heart was pounding as she pushed her way through the crowd, determined to reach him. Finally, she made it to the front of the crowd, and there he was – Jesus. He was standing in front of her, looking at her with kind, compassionate eyes. Sarah was too overwhelmed to speak, but her eyes must have told him everything. “Daughter,” Jesus said, “your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering”. Sarah felt something warm and comforting spread through her body, and suddenly the pain was gone. She could feel strength returning to her limbs, and she knew she was healed. Tears filled her eyes as she looked up at Jesus and said, “Thank you, Jesus! You are my savior, my miracle worker, my true friend. I will tell everyone I know about your power and your love.” Overcome with gratitude, Sarah stood up and praised God. She was amazed that she felt no more pain or discomfort, and that she had been healed by this man who was not only a healer but a compassionate one. The crowd around her began to cheer and clap, but Sarah could only focus on the man in front of her who had just changed her life forever. She knew she would never forget this moment, and she would always be grateful for the healing she had received.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Sarah was not the only person changed from Jesus’ arrival. Sarah’s heart was right with God, and while she had a physical healing, the town had a spiritual one. Despite chastising her when she was ill, the villagers realized that Jesus loves everyone despite their illness and struggles. They had learned that God sees beyond our physical limitations and looks at our hearts. He offers healing and comfort to those who are suffering and offers hope for a better future. He reminds us that we are never alone in our struggles and that He is always with us, guiding and supporting us. Jesus’ love is unconditional and boundless, and He welcomes all who seek Him with open arms. The villagers were overjoyed when they saw Sarah walking around the town, free from her suffering. They thanked Jesus for his healing power and welcomed him into their community. From that day on, Sarah lived a normal life and enjoyed spending time with her friends and family, and the town was forever changed by Jesus’ arrival.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">With a newfound sense of hope and joy, Sarah turned and made her way back home, ready to start a new chapter in her life. She knew that Jesus had given her a new beginning, and she would always be grateful for his love and compassion. From that day on, Sarah never stopped spreading the word about Jesus and his healing powers. Despite a lifetime of feeling unworthy, and inferior, Jesus’ power and love reminded her that she is worthy, and she felt strongly compelled to share that love with whoever would listen. She became an active member of his community, and her testimony inspired many others to seek out Jesus for healing and salvation.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This coming March 17, 2023, the American University of Health Sciences will provide food and health screenings through another Acts of Love. These quarterly days of service gives the faculty and students opportunities to reach out in service to the community. This time there will be one difference as the work will be headed up by Thida Eam, the new program director of our foundation. Ms. Suss has stepped down to focus on other priorities, but will still be very engaged. Our best wishes and prayers for both. Ms. Eam is also from Southeast Asia which is where many of the underserved in our community come from, so she has deep insight into their needs and cultural issues.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Rousseau wrote:</span> <span data-contrast=""none"">“Man is born free but everywhere is in chains.”¹</span><span data-contrast=""none"">&nbsp;Scripture says: “</span><span data-contrast=""none"">But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God’s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ” (Galatians 3: 22).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">There is similarity and a difference. Both say that people need freedom but disagree on the starting point. There is also a difference as to how we achieve freedom. Rousseau believes that people are born free. Scripture states that we are not free, even dead. As for achieving freedom, Rousseau believed:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">In his mature work, he principally explores two routes to achieving and protecting freedom: the first is a political one aimed at constructing political institutions that allow for the co-existence of free and equal citizens in a community where they themselves are sovereign; the second is a project for child development and education that fosters autonomy and avoids the development of the most destructive forms of self-interest. However, though Rousseau believes the co-existence of human beings in relations of equality and freedom is possible, he is consistently and overwhelmingly pessimistic that humanity will escape from a dystopia of alienation, oppression, and unfreedom. (Bertram, 2020, para. 1)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Scripture says that we achieve freedom by believing in Jesus Christ.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Freedom can be abused. Only virtuous people will use their freedom wisely. Rousseau’s concept is that people will treat others well if they have compassion and conscience which are developed through education and reason (Bertram, 2020). Scripture describes a three-step process beginning with salvation:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">16 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves. </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">17 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions. </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">18 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">19 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">20 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">21 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these.

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">22 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">23 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">gentleness, and self-control.

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">24 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there. </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">25 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives. </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">26 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Finally, we, in reliance on the Holy Spirit, need to develop discipline to “nail the passions and desires … to his cross” and to achieve moral excellence:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">3 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life.

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">5 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">6 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">7 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">8 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">9 </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">But those who fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The fact is books and forms of media can actually be rare or valuable. While we do trust our patrons on general principle, it is always best to lower the risk of accidents.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The brown bag medication review on Sunday, January 15, 2023, at Pastor Gregory’s church was a true opportunity that fulfilled many purposes.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">First, the faculty had a chance to conduct a research of the medication adherence for the indigent community surrounding the Long Beach area.&nbsp; The survey questions were designed to elicit answers about medication compliance, difficulty obtaining medication, adverse effects, etc.&nbsp; We had a very good number of patrons participating. However, we might need to repeat the activity in a month because not all the patrons brought their medication with them that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Secondly, this event served as a co-curricular activity for our pharmacy and nursing students.&nbsp; This particular event enabled students to develop communication skills and interdisciplinary interaction with other healthcare professions (licensed nursed, pharmacists, and medical doctors) and a diversity of patients coming from different walks of life.&nbsp; This event especially gave insight to students about the homeless population, their adversity, equity in health care, and medication access.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Third, students’ behavior and action were observed and evaluated based on the co-curricular rubric created.&nbsp; This event is included in the public health and education category, which is one of the requirements for graduation.&nbsp; The students’ knowledge, delivery techniques, communication, and assessment skills were graded.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Overall, I am glad that I was able to participate in this public health event at the Pastor’s Church.&nbsp; It gave me a feeling of altruism and service, which is an important part of being a human.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Cognitive impairment, along with long-term memory defects, is the key feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that affects more than millions of individuals in this world. In AD, the destruction of neuronal activity in the brain occurs due to the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid plaques accumulation. Oxidative stress, induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), is also a vital hallmark of AD. These ROS cause oxidative destruction of various cellular components like DNA, protein and membrane lipids, which is the representative feature of aging and progression of AD.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In a study by Dr. Smriti Tripathi, the efficacy of polyphenols such as Apple Cider Vinegar (Phenolic compound) and Chrysin (Flavonoid) are also evaluated against the above-mentioned hallmarks of AD using cell culture and animal models. The main focus is on Alzheimer’s disease pathology, molecular mechanisms, risk factors and treatments that affect AD pathology. It also includes polyphenols and their biological activity against various complications. The data demonstrates the efficacy of vii polyphenols (Chrysin and Apple Cider Vinegar) against various diseases, including AD in the animal and cellular model. This study has mainly targeted the four important pathological hallmarks of AD, namely amyloid aggregation, NFTs formation, cholinergic defects and oxidative stress.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Tripathi’s work includes the procurement of polyphenols (ACV and Chrysin), quantitative phytochemical analysis, invitro antioxidant property of test compounds as well as detailed information on the cell culture and the animal model protocols, staining procedure, antioxidant associated biochemical tests, AChE activity, histopathological studies and the biogenic amine neurotransmitter analysis have been explained appropriately.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This study demonstrated the Anti-Alzheimer’s potency of polyphenols, including Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) and Chrysin. This study has displayed that comparatively, ACV has higher antioxidant potential and is consistently found to be more effective than synthetic flavonoid Chrysin as well as anti-Alzheimer’s medication Rivastigmine in both in vitro and in vivo analysis. This neuroprotective effect of ACV is mostly associated with the alteration of the cholinergic neuronal system, protection from cellular toxicity, protection against tauopathy, amyloid aggregation and attenuation of oxidative stress. The ACV also significantly mitigates Zn with high-fat diet (HFD) induced and scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments and oxidative stress by providing antioxidant potential, anti-amnestic effects and anti-AChE action. The current study was the first step towards a larger goal of developing AD medication from a natural product.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Recently, one of our students, Vanessa Tannous, who speaks Spanish fluently, was on a routine Diabetic Neuropathy Foot Exam for several patients; Vanessa counseled a Hispanic patient who has a history of DVT and is currently on three different diuretics but neglected to be in compliance with her medication.  The patient’s feet were swollen beyond the normal range, and she (the patient) did not understand why she was suffering so much.  </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">I understand a little bit of Spanish and observed throughout the patient intervention: Vanessa not only counseled – but empowered the patient in understanding each of her medications and “WHY” she (the patient) should take the medications as prescribed.  </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Healthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice were established to advance simulation, share best practices, and provide evidence-based guidelines for the development of comprehensive standards of practice.</p>
<p>They provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Details and improved simulation operating procedures and delivery methods that the team will benefit from.</li>
<li>A demonstration of commitment to quality and rigorous evidence -based practice in improved education and better patient outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>INACSL has incorporated the following components in clinical presentations:</p>
<p>Professional Development: allows simulation to stay current and provide high quality simulation experiences that meet the educational needs of learners.</p>
<p><u>PRE-DEBRIEFING</u>:&nbsp; involves preparation and briefing before the practical session of the scenario.</p>
<p><u>SIMULATION DESIGN</u>: designed to achieve identified objectives.</p>
<p><u>FACILITATION</u>: This provides the structure needed, depending on the needs of the learners’ expected outcomes.</p>
<p>DEBRIEFING PROCESS:</p>
<p>A simulation-based debriefing includes activities of feedback and reflection.</p>
<p>Professional integrity and interprofessional education enable learners to engage in a rich environment that gives everyone a chance to learn from other professionals.</p>
<p><u>EVALUATION:</u> the learner and facilitator are evaluated with the goal of future improvement of simulation.</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">What makes Christmas merry? Is it festive lights, ugly sweaters, pine-scented decorations? What about children tearing wrapping paper off of their presents? Well, I believe it is a present—the greatest present ever: </span><span data-contrast=""none"">“This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">” (John 3: 16, MSG).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The verse continues:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn’t go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. (John 3: 16,17)</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">God gave the gift of life—eternal life to us who were dead in sin. Thanks to Adam and Eve we are all stillborn, spiritually dead, helpless to put ourselves right. This view clashes with that of many Americans such as the educator, John Dewey, who wrote: “</span><span data-contrast=""none"">The good man is the man who no matter how morally unworthy he </span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">has</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> been is moving to become better. Such a conception makes one severe in judging himself and humane in judging others” (Dewey, 1920/2012, p. 177).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">If Dewey were right, there would be no need for Christmas—merry or otherwise. We would need, however, to explain where our notions of morality derive from and why we should adopt any particular value proposed; all values would be culturally conditioned without God. Without God, we would also need to explain where the information in DNA came from as well (Meyer, 2009).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">A simpler approach is to accept Pascal’s wager, accept God’s free gift, observe whether or not your life changes for the better, and (I am certain) have a very Merry Christmas!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One of our duties here at the library is to research grants. While this does take a lot of time and careful evaluation, it is a potentially valuable source of university funding. Some grants have the added advantage of increasing the AUHS faculty’s level of prestige and experience. For example, many grants require their recipients to do research projects which require them to help others or increase human knowledge. It is important to realize that, even after the money has been spent, the honor of being quoted by the experts will still remain.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This winter, people could contract “flurona,” a disorder known as COVID and the flu at the same time. This is just an additional reason for getting both the influenza and COVID vaccines. There are currently booster vaccinations for the coronavirus Omicron variant available. It is advised that individuals 65 and older have the adjuvant or the higher dose of the flu vaccine, rather than the normal dose. According to a study published in </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">The New England Journal of Medicine</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">, elderly people have a six-fold increased risk of having a heart attack within seven days of getting the flu. This increase in symptom severity, with the potential for a greater requirement for ventilation, may result in death. It’s essential to differentiate between the flu and COVID symptoms and their characteristics. For accurate diagnosis and to begin treatment as soon as practical:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The United States is experiencing a post-Thanksgiving spike in incidence and hospitalizations following a fall-season COVID-19 lag. It’s crucial for people to take preventative action, which includes testing whenever they experience COVID-19 symptoms or an exposure, as well as before social gatherings with individuals at high risk of developing a serious illness, such as those over 65, those with underlying medical conditions, or those who are immunocompromised. If accessible, a thermometer and pulse oximeter are usually useful for accurate diagnosis, as well. People who have already been exposed to COVID may contract it again. People are susceptible to re-infection or rebound, but with milder symptoms, especially if they have received vaccinations. Long COVID is a serious problem that persists for months after an initial infection and can be quite debilitating. Long COVID is defined by the World Health Organization as having fatigue, shortness of breath, and brain fog for at least two months without any other known reasons. People with at least six COVID symptoms were more likely to experience prolonged COVID, which could have an impact on daily activities and mental health. Washing hands often, using protective masks, and taking antivirals like Paxlovid can reduce the chance of death and help keep individuals out of the hospital. Acetaminophen, cough drops, throat lozenges, and Tamiflu are medications that are also available. Everyone should stay healthy by getting plenty of sun, involving physical activities such as walking or jogging, getting more than six hours of sleep each night, and drinking plenty of water. Soups can help with hydration, relieve congestion, and aid in the excretion of mucus. Avoiding smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, with proper diet may also help.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">By studying antibody landscapes, scientists are designing more strategic vaccines, but with so many strains existing among birds, humans, and other animals, the virus has the opportunity—and genetic tendency—to mutate and change so we are encouraged to receive the “predicted vaccine” even though it is nearly impossible to predict new mutations.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Along with an active immune response against the current tetravalent (4 strains) vaccine or the trivalent (3 strains) vaccine, the immune system responds to the strains it has encountered in the past … a process now referred to as “back boost.”&nbsp; Contrary to what one has been told in the past, our immune system has memory and studies from the 2009 variant outbreak indicated that the memory can last for decades.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Ibalizumab-uiyk (Trogarzo) is an FDA approved IV-infusion treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 or HIV-1. It is commonly used to treat patients alongside other antiretroviral medications such as nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). In 2018, the FDA approved the drug as an IV initial loading dose in the beginning of treatment. This dose is to be followed by a maintenance dose every two weeks and the IV maintenance dose is to be administered over the course of 15 minutes.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In 2022, the FDA approved ibalizumab-uiyk as an HIV-1 IV-push treatment to be given once every two weeks, but now over the course of only 30 seconds. This change reduces the amount of time that patients are required to stay at clinics and health facilities.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">A TMB-302, phase 3 trial was initially conducted to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of ibalizumab-uiyk. The study was able to prove the efficacy in administration as IV push was similar to its use as IV infusion Once the study showed the appropriate efficacy, it was approved as IV-push treatment in a dose of 800 mg which can be labeled as a maintenance dose.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">According to the study, the participants who had Multidrug Resistant (MDR)-HIV and received ibalizumab-uiyk, resulted in viral load reduction. Those who received ibalizumab-uiyk also had an increased count of CD4 cells. The total number of participants in the study who received ibalizumab-uiyk treatment was 350. The study was able to provide specific reconstitution instructions.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Ibalizumab-uiyk is initially administered as a loading dose at 2000 mg. Following the loading dose is the maintenance dose of 800 mg and diluted in a 250 ML solution of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP and administered every two weeks as an intravenous infusion. An exception to this reconstitution, is to administer a maintenance dose of ibalizumab-uiyk as an undiluted IV push over 30 seconds. The exception to intravenous infusion may allow pharmacists to reduce preparation time for this treatment.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It is important to note the side effects of ibalizumab-uiyk which may be diarrhea, dizziness, nausea and rash.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In conclusion, the efficacy of ibalizumab-uiyk has been proved to be beneficial in patients with MDR-HIV. It can also be administered in two ways which may allow reduction in preparation time. This is such an important breakthrough in science for those who have been diagnosed with HIV since it may benefit those who have tried other treatments that failed to reduce HIV levels.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs), a recent evolution in the area of targeted drug therapy, has&nbsp; been proven to be effective in the treatment of various disorders. The first FDA approved mAb was muromonab-CD3, a CD3 T-cell inhibitor, used for transplant rejection. By 2014, there were approximately 30 FDA approved mAbs therapies on the market. With the rapid progression of technology and incentives to dive into this field, more mAbs are being tested in drug pipelines for indications including but not limited to cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and a variety of immune system conditions. It is expected for the mAB market to grow by 300% between 2020 and 2023 and bring in a gross revenue around $524.68 billion. With these medications being one of the most expensive medications in pharmacy formularies, it is hard to see why companies would not invest in this ever-growing field.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Putting profits aside, it’s important to note that due to the infancy of this class of medications, rare side effects continue to pop up in case studies. One example is the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of cancers like melanoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Between 2021 to 2022, several case studies have documented adverse reactions affecting multiple organ systems. An 81-year-old male in Japan developed myocardial damage on this regimen while a fatal case of cardiac arrythmia was reported in a 66-year-old female in the United States. Enteritis was reported in a 62-year-old male in France, and sarcoid-like reactions were reported in a 54-year-old female from China. While monoclonal antibody treatments show a lot of favorable outcomes in their clinical trials, these case studies remind us that the long-term effects can still surprise us with unexpected adverse reactions. As healthcare providers, we should continue to not only review our current knowledge but update ourselves on newer side effects as monoclonal antibodies continue to flood the therapeutic market.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><span data-contrast=""auto"">By Maria Shearing, MSN-FNP(C), NEd​, RN, PHN, Director of Clinical Facilities</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Nursing eating their young is a term that has been used in healthcare for a long time. However, it occurs across a wide span of nursing careers. The phrase does not mean that nurses are cannibals, but rather, some senior nurses exhibit bullying and unprofessional behavior toward the transitioning and fresh graduate nurses in the working environment (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Kreedi et al., 2022)</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. In this case, bullying is examined in terms of personal-related and work-related negative behaviors like ignoring targets, intimidation of new nurses by senior nurses, and withholding relevant support information that could help young and fresh nurses execute their assigned duties. Given the complexity and challenges in the healthcare field, transitioning and fresh newly registered nurses face difficulties in adapting to the ever-changing trends and practices in the nursing field, raising an issue of human resource management and development in the healthcare field (Gillespie et al., 2017).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Researchers in the medical field commonly report cases of bullying, lack of mentorship, and support for newly licensed nurses by supervisors, physicians, and other nurse leaders (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Labrague, 2021)</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. Several studies reveal that new nursing graduates often experience healthcare challenges, especially in their transition period, in areas like job orientation, role expectation, workload, confidence, and fear. Most new nurse graduates feel insecure and lose confidence and morale during the transition. New nurse graduates begin to fear they are unworthy of their roles and not professional enough to be awarded an opportunity to serve for that which they have worked so hard for in their nursing school. These forms of workplace bullying are widespread across the nursing spectrum and have grown into a normal phenomenon as a practice that is regarded as “just the way things are (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Labrague, 2021)</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">.” This is a growing concern because it has led to student nurses being degraded, powerless, and inadequate in their nursing profession which then feeds into the workplace as they become new grad registered nurses.&nbsp; This idea does not simply apply to new grads working at the bedside, this also occurs in academia. Rather than seeing the new grads as a threat, we should see and think about how we can mentor and build them up, so that when they are senior nurses, they will do the same for the incoming new grads.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Gillespie et al. (2017) argue that it is undeniable that the nursing workplace is stressful. All nurses, including senior, junior, and new nurses, have copious responsibilities while patients’ lives are on the line. Such inevitable pressures, coupled with harassment and bullying of new nurses, always take a toll on their well-being and mental health. It is a common occurrence in the healthcare system that stressed-out nurse graduates take out their frustrations on their colleagues and, worse still, on the patients (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Joseph et al., 2022)</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. Regardless, when young nurses are insulted, bullied, and ignored, they lose trust in their capabilities. Such additional stress levels and existing nurse-related pressures negatively affect the quality of patient care and nurse productivity.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Therefore, nurses eating their young is an issue that must be addressed because nurses require guided mentorship that successfully transitions them into their practice. The nursing field continues to evolve, and with technological advancements, nursing practices continue to change; hence new nurses must be guided and mentored to fit into the ever-changing medical field. Every nurse in the nursing field is a team player because the nursing field requires a holistic approach that relies on a collaborative nursing experience. Nurses differ in their areas of operation, expertise, and qualifications, but their roles are interconnected, making it necessary for all junior, new, and senior nurses to work together.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The library catalog and the internet are both wonderful search tools. One may type virtually anything into the search box and be sure of receiving information. With such ease of use, it is reasonable to ask for the purpose of perfecting our skills in creating precise search terms, also known as keywords. The fact of the matter is that it is never a bad idea to improve one’s chances of getting fast, accurate results.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The thing about databases is that they attempt to match all the search results that the researcher types. Since this is the case, a search for “diabetes in calico tomcats” may lead to results for calico cats, tomcats, and diabetes, but not necessarily to publications which discuss all three of them as a single issue. In brief, instead of getting the desired articles, one may end up with inferior or irrelevant materials.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">So, how can you improve your keyword creation skills? The answer is that one must practice. It requires a series of trials and errors to understand which words should be included in one’s search terms. Fortunately, students and instructors have many projects which will encourage them to engage in this exercise. If you would like some assistance, our library also runs programs to aid our patrons in this quest. Feel free to call upon us at any time.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Our family were always heavily involved in Church, my parents in Leadership and events. All my siblings were in Orchestra, Choir, or serving in the Children’s ministry. Our church was mid-sized, about 350 members, so all members had a chance to serve in the Church. My contribution was to help with the audio/tech team. I have worked in Audio production for over 15 years, and only recently “retired” from leading the Technology department. The technical and computer skills that I gained in serving the church have been invaluable, and I recommend that every young person volunteer in their Church. I believe that I could not be in the position I am in now without the skills I learned by serving in the Technology department.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Before coming to AUHS, David worked for Los Angeles Unified School District and taught high school students skills that would prepare them for professions in the healthcare field.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">David’s dream is to use evidence-based practice to improve learning through simulation and interprofessional education. A dream we all share here at AUHS!

This fair featured cholesterol screenings by Dignity Health St. Mary Medical Center and free vaccinations by Walgreens. Colgate provided toothbrushes and dental education to children and adults. A big hit was the Tessie Cleveland Community Services game trailer with mental health education. Hundreds of bags of groceries were handed out as well as dozens of books to children.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">I am always amazed at the diversity exhibited at these outreaches.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">At the same time, the Foundation held a book fair to give books to school children from low-income families.&nbsp; New books were purchased thanks to a grant from the Long Beach Neighborhood Foundation. Children also got toothbrushes from Colgate and enjoyed crafts including decorating a pumpkin.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Put another way, we desire good relationships, provision of physical needs, health, and a strong character. The question is how to achieve these goals. This is where we need to understand the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God is where all aspects of life are in harmony under the rule of God.&nbsp; In our Salt and Light campus ministry we work to extend the rule of the Kingdom: to worship God, be transformed, and minister to those around us. We do this through understanding the domains of holistic health and the means of improving that health. Let us look briefly at the phases of the Kingdom of God, the holistic health benefits of the Kingdom, and the process by which God’s rule is extended in our lives and the world.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In the beginning, people were placed in an environment where all their needs were taken care of: food was easy to obtain, relationships with God and each other were excellent, there was no disease, and people had no character flaws.&nbsp; We can add in a fifth domain – meaningful work. Adam and Eve were tasked with ruling Creation under the rule of God.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Sadly, they disobeyed the one command they had been given, and people became separated from God and the benefits of His rule.&nbsp; Their character changed for the worse, then their relationships became broken, food became difficult to obtain, work became burdensome, and they got sick and died.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">First, we extend the Kingdom extensively by making disciples of all nations.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Second, we extend the Kingdom intensively through three channels of grace for transformation: the Spirit of God, the Word of God, and the People of God.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The Spirit brings about the fruit of the Spirit, gives us gifts to use in ministry, and draws our attention to areas where God’s rule needs extension. The Spirit also intercedes for us.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The Word identifies areas that need transformation, tells us about our glorious God, and provides the framework of belief for our life and examples to follow (or avoid). The main genres are narrative, commandment, prophetic rebuke, exposition of life in the kingdom, and prayer. We need to properly interpret and obey God’s Word for it to be fully effective.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The People of God are also used by the Spirit to encourage, admonish, and strategize with us. Also, while individual worship is great, the Bible emphasizes corporate worship. It is only in a group that we normally, fully experience the love of God and the benefits of His Kingdom. That is why meeting as a group is central to Salt and Light.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Finally, we use the discipleship cycle (modified from the description by Intervarsity Christian Fellowship) to move through the process of extending the Kingdom. The first step in the cycle is to identify brokenness or rebellion — an area where God’s rule is not extended in my life or in that of others. The next step is to determine how God’s rule can be extended; this involves using the three means of grace to determine what God’s Word says to do. The third step is to clarify action steps. The fourth step is to obey by implementing the steps. The fifth step is to praise God for His work of extending His Kingdom and to reflect on what else needs to be done.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">We can see this cycle in Acts 2: 37-47: recognition of rebellion/sin, determine action steps, obey, and praise.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Information literacy, “a set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (Theme, 2022) is extremely important. One cannot do research or write articles without this awareness, as it guides when and how to do research. For hundreds of years, this skill has been associated with libraries. Why is this the case?</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect, and for many years there was no other place to practice one’s literacy. Additionally, school librarians are usually required to teach students how to locate and analyze information. After all, it is only fair, when giving patrons access to evaluate resources, to ensure that these people can also use them effectively.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The article is well-organized, even though it does not follow the standard structure of an essay. Nguyen’s story is entirely based on his personal experience and feelings when sharing the pain and hardship of refugees, who suffered loss when leaving their homeland and trying to adjust to a new life. Clearly, Nguyen’s evaluation is considered to be subjective, but his heartfelt and emotional story is undeniably inspiring. To analyze the article’s structure, we will discuss the main idea, the organization and the supporting evidence that help deliver the author’s message. As in the main idea, the article portrays a rough picture of the author’s life and his struggles as a refugee, describing how he is shaped and chased by the “refugee” tag as trying to adapt to the new life. Rather than following the general organization of a typical essay with a clear introduction, body paragraphs and a conclusion, the author shares his story chronologically, based on the events that he experienced. No introduction is found. The paper has a conclusion with a thesis statement coming at the end. Nguyen states: “When those others fight back … caused and denied” (Nguyen, 2020). The thesis statement appears to be not quite clear as standing alone. However, the author’s whole story lays a solid foundation for his point, which makes it rational to place the thesis at the end, consolidating the main idea of the paper. Clearly, the structure of the essay is simple but the content is profound. Besides that, not all paragraphs have a clear topic sentence. For example, in the paragraph located before the conclusion on page 26, which is about how refugees are treated, the main idea is not fully expressed in the first sentence but comes out more clearly with the support of the second sentence. In terms of supporting evidence, the article is a narrative story</div>

<div class=""textLayer"">3based on the author’s own life without the participation of information from studies, research or statistics. Even so, it is still relatable and makes readers think of what it is like to be a refugee. This is also greatly contributed by the use of parallel structure throughout the article as well as in several small paragraphs, making Nguyen’s idea memorable to readers. For example, he mentions in a paragraph: “… Republic of Vietnam, a country that no longer exists except in the imagination of its global refugee diaspora of several million people, a country that most of the world remembers as South Vietnam” (Nguyen, 2020). The word “a country” is repeated in the same sentence, not only to emphasize the author’s home country, but also to express his painful feelings when thinking about his homeland. More importantly, throughout the entire article, there is repetition of memorable phrases like: “I remember”, “I do not remember” and “I have to”. The word “remember” appears especially and frequently. It shows the author’s emphasis on every point that he makes as recounting his memories. They consist of what he remembers, what he does not, and what he tries not to remember. With these memorable phrases placed at the beginning of some paragraphs, they also act as transitions and connections, attaching and making the whole article coherent. A few minor grammatical errors can be found in the article. For instance, at the beginning, the author writes: “At four years of age I became …”, in which there should be a comma after the word “age”. Another example can be seen in page 25, where Nguyen writes: “… losing her self …” when the correct grammar is supposed to be “losing herself”. Lastly, the writer uses standard American written English.On top of that, the effectiveness of the article can be considered undeniable with a clear purpose. “Viet Thanh Nguyen” is written for a wide range of audiences. They include individuals who are not refugees and even who hold negative perspectives towards refugees, allowing them to truly understand what it feels like for someone to permanently leave their home country</div>

<div class=""page"" data-page-number=""4"" data-loaded=""true"">
<div class=""textLayer"">4behind. The writing is also intended for individuals, who were once refugees, so they can feel for those who are in a similar situation. To begin the article, the author certainly succeeds in identifying himself as a refugee, not an immigrant, and explaining why he does so. I am not sure if I am impressed with the opening but I like the way Nguyen chooses to go straight to the topic issue, not circling around. More importantly, examples are given as much as possible to support the author’s main point. Nguyen does not hesitate to share his past stories of the war, poverty and difficulties to adapt the new life, which are described in great detail even though they are traumatic memories for him. For example, he writes: “… I remember the gunman who followed us home and knocked on our door and pointed a gun in all our faces and how my mother saved us by running past him and out onto the sidewalk …” (Nguyen, 2020). Through it, readers can imagine a full picture of the struggles that the author and his family have had to go through as a Vietnamese refugee since he was at the age of four, moving to the Philippines before arriving to the refugee camp in Pennsylvania of the USA. This is not to mention how their lives were socially and economically shaped and determined as refugees. As the author defines the issue, I cannot think of other counter arguments. The article is subjective as it is based on the author’s raw experiences and emotions. There is a lack of quantitative information, which is understandable since the author’s intention is not to suggest any solution or new approaches to help the refugee community less struggle. It is written to give the public a deep insight into refugees, who have suffered loss and struggles from displacement in their own skin. When placed with other articles written by refugees from different countries in the collection, it helps to make the author’s point more powerful, persuasive and inspiring. Also, because the narration is sorely based on a personal story, it is hard to say if there are any sweeping generalizations that go beyond the evidence.</div>

<div class=""textLayer"">5In conclusion, the article helps me better understand the pain and hardships that refugees have to endure when forsaking their homeland as well as learning how to adjust to a new life. All the life events and feelings of the author are described in such detail that I feel they are incredibly real and vivid despite the lack of quantitative data. Refugees are always a controversial topic and are accompanied by comments, assumptions and even prejudices. It is important to be open minded and see the world from different aspects as refugees are also human. They have their stories and their own voices that need to be heard.</div>

" New Evidence Suggests Pandemic Came from Nature, Not a Lab, Panel Says",https://news.auhs.edu/saliva-could-help-detecting-health-related-physiological-changes/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1-540x403.png,Trinium Newsletter,"<p><strong>New evidence suggests pandemic came from nature, not a lab, panel says</strong></p>
<p><em>By Oksana Zayachkivska, MD, PhD, DSc</em></p>
<p><em>Professor of Physiology, AUHS School of Medicine</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is essentially the title of a recent editorial in <em>Science </em>(1), one of the most prestigious scientific journals of the world (Fig. 1). Namely, soon after the outbreak of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, pandemic speculations started about the origins of the rapidly spreading disease, i.e., did it come from the wheat market, where raw meat originating from wild animals has been sold in Wuhan, China. Or was the SARS-CoV-2 virus created in the well-known Wuhan Institute of Virology from which it escaped (e.g., by the contamination of researchers who worked there)? The scientific and public debate continued over many months, especially after the site-inspection committee, put together by the World Health Organization (WHO) could not reach a uniform conclusion about the origin of the SARS-CoV-2. Now, a seminal multidisciplinary paper published in the well-respected <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (<em>PNAS)</em> on October 10, 2022 concluded that “increasing scientific evidence concerning the origins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most consistent with a zoonotic origin and a spillover pathway from wildlife to people via wildlife farming and the wildlife trade” (2). &nbsp;Subsequently, a scientific panel was put together that also confirmed the conclusion of the Keusch et al. study (2). The main findings were then summarized in the editorial of <em>Science</em>, &amp; more recently reviewed in the respected British weekly <em>The Economist</em> (3).</p>
<p>Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 belongs to RNA viruses which are widely distributed in the human population from the 1990-s. It is a fact that they are responsible for the creation 3 recent epidemics/pandemics: 2002, 2012, and 2019 (Fig.2). It is also a known fact that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks which created the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified in bats on sale at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan (China). From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were alternative hypotheses for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 postulated that it was constructed, cultured, or experimentally manipulated in a laboratory or was associated with field surveillance of bats, leading to an intentional or accidental release.</p>
<p>The recent paper from a group of authors (Keusch GT, and co-workers) (2) discusses the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a laboratory or distributed from wild animals. It is now widely considered very probable that the emergence of the virus came via wildlife farms and the wildlife trade, including by the US intelligence community (https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Unclassified-Summary-of-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdf). However, laboratory accidents do happen, and no independent formal audit of the Wuhan laboratory facilities has been possible in the wake of geopolitical conflicts. The authors also present several critical control points about the farming and trade of wildlife to prevent wildlife spillovers (Fig.3), as well as approaches to implement principles about targeted surveillance at the animal-human interfaces at these sites. Furthermore, they suggest innovating new strategies and methods for risk assessment of surveillance, the importance of investment in translational research for priority viruses and virus families with high epidemic or pandemic potential.</p>
<p>Symbiosis of efforts of cross-disciplinary collaborative research and all national, regional, and international public health providers will help create a One Health–based governance base for pandemic preparedness and response.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a combination of good scientific detective work and rational use of public health principles provided good guidelines even in the evolution of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

Low molecular weight proteins (5-30 kDa) are usually filtered out into the urine under normal conditions. </span><span data-contrast=""none"">The standard way to estimate GFR (eGFR) is a simple blood test that measures serum creatinine levels</span> <span data-contrast=""none"">(a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles).</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> When the kidney function is compromised in acute or chronic situations, GFR usually declines. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Shrunken pore syndrome (SPS) is a renal disorder which is characterized by </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">decreased renal clearance of low molecular weight proteins or peptides. However, creatinine levels remain normal, making it not a viable marker for measurement. In this case, Cystatin C </span><span data-contrast=""none"">(a protein that slows down the breakdown of other protein cells)</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> serves as a superior marker in the prediction of SPS</span><span data-contrast=""none"">. The reason being, Cystatin C helps in identifying the disruptions in the filtration process in the pore model of glomerular filtration. The </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">pathophysiology of this syndrome involves a decrease in the diameter of a fraction of the pores of the glomerular membrane impairing the filtration of big molecules and to a lesser extent water or creatinine. </span><span data-contrast=""none"">Also, the amount of Cystatin C varies much less with the muscle mass and no tubular section compared to creatinine. SPS is diagnosed when the </span><span data-contrast=""none"">eGFR cystatin C/eGFR creatinine-ratio &lt;0.60 (&lt;60-70%)</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. The mortality of this condition is associated with cardiovascular risk. The incidence of SPS is mostly in the elderly population but highly variable owing to its poor prognosis. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">The prevalence of SPS is between 0.2 and 36%. Treatment options may involve monoclonal antibodies to reduce the levels of lethal signaling proteins. The limited information about SPS necessitates the procurement of better diagnostic measures and treatment modalities.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">I was blessed and fortunate enough to teach the Professional Communication class to our Cohort 4 during the first quarter of their first year in our Pharm.D. program.&nbsp; Incorporating the concept of Professionalism into the class is a natural part of Professional Communication.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">I encourage my students to apply to the Board of Pharmacy as soon as they can for their Pharmacist Intern licenses.&nbsp; The Pharmacist Intern license will not only raise the student’s self-esteem but also raise the bar of expectation, accountability, and confidence, as the student is now a licensed professional.&nbsp; Many Pharm.D. programs usually have a White Coat ceremony before the students start their Pharmacy Practice Experience rotations.&nbsp; Once the student puts on the white coat, that student is now a healthcare professional licensed by the state to serve and educate patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">I encourage our students to introduce themselves to other healthcare providers and patients as “pharmacist interns” and not as “pharmacy students.” Using appropriate terminology will help shift the intern’s perception from that of a student to that of an intern healthcare practitioner.&nbsp; This also shifts the other healthcare providers’ and patients’ perceptions toward the Pharmacist Intern.&nbsp; The Pharmacist Intern now transposes into the role of an educator to educate patients and other providers about pharmacy knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The recent COVID-19 Pandemic has caused schools of all kinds to modify how they deliver education. One of the elements that AUHS has embraced is a deeper integration of simulation in the Nursing and Pharmacy programs. This decision was made due to the evidenced-based best practices that have been documented in research. In particular, a 2014 study asked the question “Can simulation deliver the same education that standard clinical experience gives students?” (Hayden, Smiley, Alexander, Kardong-Edgren, &amp; Jeffries, 2014).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The results were staggering: Not only did all the groups doing simulation perform similarly to the traditional clinical sessions, but the higher the amount of simulation, the better the long-term results! (Hayden, Smiley, Alexander, Kardong-Edgren, &amp; Jeffries, 2014). This clearly indicates the power of simulation to provide education that equals or exceeds traditional clinical sessions.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Nursing schools are regulated by Boards of Nursing in the States they reside in, and the California Board of Nursing has been using the above-mentioned study as a basis for additional research in the use of simulation in Nursing programs. During the COVID pandemic, the California BRN increased the amount of simulation that can be used in Nursing program as a way of dealing with reduced clinical availability, but also based on the results of this study. Here at AUHS we seek to implement evidence-based best practices in all we do, and we are happy to see that our simulation program is growing. Our goal is to positively impact ALL our students.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Grant proposal for a new saliva test from AUHS School of Medicine (SOM)</strong></p>
<p>Human readiness for performing important routine and essential tasks is a vital skill. The quality of human performance of neurocognitive processes (memory, attention, thought process) as well as physical condition are related to physiology-based metabolic homeostasis. Saliva is a biofluid that reflects not only the health of the local oral cavity but could also serve as a “mirror” of general health (1). Using biosensors for noninvasive rapid evaluation human health is modern diagnostic approach in preventive medicine and health care. In our previous study in animal models of human esophageal and gastric diseases, we showed that normal salivation provides the necessary amount of numerous bioactive molecules that also exert cytoprotection of the esophagogastric mucosa (2). Our previous study was also related to the study of saliva microcrystallization in humans as an easy-to-do, non-invasive and inexpensive method for the detection of changes in homeostasis mostly of its neuro-hormonal control (2).</p>
<p>Saliva microcrystallization is the part process of biopolymerization – the formation of solid crystals precipitating from biofluids in which from a liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs. Taking in account that nature of the crystallization process refers to both thermodynamic and kinetic factors (motion of the molecules and the forces and energy acting on them), which can reflect current “real-time” condition of personal metabolic homeostasis and performance activities.&nbsp; It highly variable and under control of many physiology-based factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>human condition,</li>
<li>activities,</li>
<li>age,</li>
<li>sex,</li>
<li>circadian influences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our hypothesis was to shown that detection types of saliva microcrystallization can be used as an additional method of estimation of integrated view on human health condition and individual stress resilience. Our obtained results using saliva were based on the detection of changes in the pattern of microcrystallization, after dehydration of saliva drops.&nbsp; We detected different morphological types of saliva microcrystallization using microscopic and macro-magnification photo recording by existing cell phone technology. They were strong visual changes in the appearance of saliva microcrystallization under different human activities and stress conditions (3, 4).</p>

</ul>
<p>By Sandor Szabo, MD, PhD, MPH, Dean and Professor, AUHS School of Medicine AUHS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An editorial in the one of the best and most prestigious scientific journals of the world, <em>Nature</em> (Aug. 11, 2022) proclaimed: “Pig organs partially revived in dead animals – researchers are stunned” (1). But the editorial also warns scientists that “the findings aren’t yet clinically relevant, but say the research raises ethical questions about the definition of death.”&nbsp; Namely, in the study, originally published in the Aug. 3, 2022, issue of <em>Nature</em> showed that “pigs that received a blood substitute from a system called OrganEx showed activity in their heart, liver and kidneys after death” (1, 2). The OrganEx was a special solution that contained the animals’ blood and 13 compounds, including anticoagulants and nutrients. This slowed the decomposition and quickly restored some organ function, such as heart contraction and activity in the liver and kidney:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This publication follows the experiments in 2019 by the same scientists at Yale University in which they revived the disembodied brains of pigs four hours after the animals died, calling into question the idea that brain death is final (3).</p>
<p><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19556"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1.png"" alt="""" width=""613"" height=""560"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1.png 613w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-300x274.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px""></a></p>
<p>These studies indeed have major implications for not only the definition of death, but for our teaching students about cell and tissue injury. Namely, we tell medical, pharmacy and nursing students about reversible and irreversible stages of cell injury: in reversible damage (caused by lack of oxygen &amp; nutrients delivery by blood, i.e., ischemia, chemicals, bacteria, or viruses) the injury to the cell membrane or mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum may be reversible if the exposure to the etiologic agent does not last for a long time (4-6). During irreversible cell damage, on the other hand, that involves injury to cell nucleus, there is no return. &nbsp;On the basis of these concepts, reinforced in old and new textbooks of pathology and pathophysiology, we teach students about the sensitivity of our organs to lack of oxygen/blood flow during ischemia (e.g., caused by heart attack). Namely, we teach that our neurons in the brain are the least tolerant to lack of blood flow, followed by myocardium (heart) and tubular epithelial cells (in kidney):</p>
<ul>
<li>Irreversible brain damage occurs in 3-5 mins</li>
<li>Heart myocardium in 15-20 mins</li>
<li>Renal tabular epithelial damage in 30-40 mins.</li>
</ul>
<p>These data have important implications in cardio-pulmonary resuscitations (e.g., after heart attack): this is the reason that we need to start resuscitation efforts (i.e., compressing the chest/heart and blowing air through the mouth to deliver at least minimum oxygen to the lungs) as soon as possible, i.e., within 2-3 mins after someone collapses during myocardial infarction.&nbsp; The other practical implication is that harvesting organs (e.g., kidney, liver) should occur as soon as possible after brain death or catastrophic traumatic body injury. &nbsp;The organ harvesting period may be prolonged, if the recently published new finding with harvested pig organs is confirmed by other scientists.</p>
<p>Thus, based on the recently published new results on pig organ preservation after death, we may need to revise what we teach about cell and tissue/organ injury. However, we should not change our practice in providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation after heart attack — at least not for the time being!</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Botox®, Dysport®, and Xeomin</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">® injections are popular cosmetic procedures.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons over 17 billion dollars was spent on cosmetic procedures in the United States in 2022. Breast augmentations, breast lifts, and buttock augmentation with fat grafting (“Brazilian Butt Lift” or “BBL”) were among the most popular cosmetic surgical procedures, Chemical peels, laser hair removal, and botulinum toxin type A injections, were also popular. These and other minimally invasive cosmetic procedures represent over 80% of the total cosmetic procedures performed in 2022. Overall, administration of botulinum toxin type A, including Botox®, Dysport®, and Xeomin</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">® was the most popular minimally invasive cosmetic procedure performed.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Botulinum toxin type A is a specific medical formulation of botulinum toxin. This toxin is produced by selected species of Clostridium bacteria, including Clostridium botulinum, which are found throughout our environment. In humans, the toxin binds to nerve cells and prevents the release of certain chemicals that are involved in muscle contraction. In the presence of botulinum toxin, muscle cells are unable to contract, and they become paralyzed. When botulinum toxin type A is injected for cosmetic purposes, this muscle paralysis results in a temporary decrease in wrinkles and frown lines. The medical use of botulinum toxin type A dates to the 1940’s, when injections of the toxin were used as a treatment for strabismus (crossed eyes). Since then, the toxin has been used to treat muscle spasticity and excessive salivation in addition to cosmetic conditions.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">All forms of botulism can cause severe symptoms including profound muscle weakness, double vision, and difficulty swallowing. If untreated, the disease can progress to respiratory failure and death. Even with treatment, the signs and symptoms of botulism can last for months and may result in permanent complications. There is an antidote for botulism called botulinum antitoxin. The antitoxin does not reverse muscle paralysis or other symptoms that have already occurred, but it can prevent the development of additional signs or symptoms of the disease.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In summary, Botulinum toxin is a very potent poison, and exposure to small amounts of the toxin can cause severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers botulism to be a high-priority bioterrorism agent. Even though botulism exposure is dangerous in small amounts, the amounts used for cosmetic procedures are significantly smaller than the amounts needed to cause disease in humans. For this reason, it is extremely rare for people to experience signs and symptoms of botulism after receiving injections of the medical formulations of botulinum toxin.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">My experience in teaching introductory science courses to pharmacy students began in 1991.&nbsp; Before joining the University of Kansas School of Pharmacy (KU SOP) as Chair of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry, I had spent ten years as a professional scientist in the Central Research Department of DuPont and the last few years as Research Supervisor of the Enzyme Mechanisms Group.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Entering a classroom of 100 undergraduate B. Pharm. students was like jumping into a pool of ice water.&nbsp; It was immediately apparent that I spoke a language foreign to our first-year pharmacy students.&nbsp; Over time it became clear that many of the assumptions I had about what students did and didn’t know about science were incorrect.&nbsp; I assumed that students who had recently taken one year of general chemistry and one year of organic chemistry had a basic knowledge of the subject.&nbsp; While this proved to be correct for some students, for others, perhaps the majority, this proved to be a significant miscalculation.&nbsp; Despite passing the prerequisite chemistry courses, nearly half of our students knew little or no chemistry.&nbsp; Many first-year pharmacy students were not well prepared for courses like medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, pharmaceutics, or pathophysiology, all courses required by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).&nbsp; Shortly after joining the University of Kansas, all pharmacy programs in the United States moved from Bachelor of Pharmacy degrees (B. Pharm.) to Doctor of Pharmacy degrees (PharmD), which became the entry-level degree for a professional pharmacist.&nbsp; As Chair of Medicinal Chemistry, I became involved in meetings to determine the necessary changes in the pharmacy curriculum for the new PharmD degree.&nbsp; One of the first decisions was to include biochemistry as an entry-level course in the new PharmD curriculum.&nbsp; Previously, biochemistry was a required prerequisite for acceptance into the KU SOP program.&nbsp; Students who took biochemistry before entering the program knew little or no biochemistry.&nbsp; Participants from the Department of Medicinal Chemistry decided that if the KU SOP redesigned the curriculum again, it would be wise to take ownership of organic chemistry since it was clear pharmacy students had not learned the expected material before matriculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">What about modern PharmD programs?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Since 1991, US pharmacy schools have increased from 80 to over 140 ACPE-accredited programs.&nbsp; There has been a continuing trend away from the traditional role that pharmacy has played in maintaining strength in chemical science and toward an increase in physical assessments, patient counseling, vaccinations, and other areas traditionally covered by nursing, physician assistants, and physicians.&nbsp; The result is that many pharmacists, especially those from the newer pharmacy programs, have less command of the basic chemical sciences that have traditionally served as the underlying basis of pharmacy.&nbsp; Worse yet, in some instances, pharmacy graduates can be chemically illiterate, lacking the basic skills to understand and communicate the fundamental science component of therapeutic substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Increasingly, some students ask, “Teach me only what is necessary.”&nbsp; The problem with this request is that we never know what will be ‘necessary’ in the future for all students.&nbsp; Things change, and what is ‘necessary’ today may prove to be obsolete in later years.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Teaching the minimum ‘necessary’ today limits the career options for our graduates.&nbsp; In truth, it is impossible to teach only what is necessary.&nbsp; Much of what pharmacists need to know they learn after graduation.&nbsp; The best strategy is to teach our students how to learn and enable ‘life-long learning’, which requires that they have a solid foundation in the basic sciences, particularly the chemical and biological sciences.&nbsp; What if they do not know the ‘language’ of chemistry and biology?&nbsp; In that case, it becomes much more difficult to understand new material and research, learn, and apply new knowledge they encounter after graduation.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Teaching what is ‘necessary’ without a solid foundation in the basic sciences is training, not education.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Education at the doctoral level requires preparation of the student to become capable of independent, self-motivated, and self-initiated education.&nbsp; For the pharmaceutical sciences, a solid education in the chemical and biological sciences is necessary for independent, life-long learning.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Feedback from more than 2,000 students, post-graduation, during the past 30 years has strongly reinforced my attitudes surrounding the education of pharmacy students.&nbsp; While students may not appreciate the difficulty of learning basic science while in school, many come to appreciate the effort they spent learning the essential tools of independent, self-directed scholarship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">On August 12, 2022, one of my former PhD students, Dr. Sara Wu, gave a faculty-development presentation at AUHS, attended by faculty (SOP and SOM), AUHS pharmacy students, and colleagues from Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), entitled:&nbsp; “New Drug Development from CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control) Perspectives”, covering work she had carried out at Eisai, Wyeth/Pfizer, Cempra Pharmaceutics, G1 Therapeutics, and Celcuity Inc pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp; Dr. Wu is currently the Executive Director of Pharmaceutical Development at Celcuity, Inc, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.&nbsp; Dr. Wu obtained her Ph.D. under the direction of her advisor, Prof. John Schloss, at the University of Kansas, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, and conducted postdoctoral work with Prof. Valentino J. Stella, University of Kansas, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, working on the formulation of anticancer drugs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Since Prof. Stella was a former student of the legendary Prof. Takeru Higuchi, ‘the father of physical pharmacy’, this makes her a ‘scientific granddaughter’ of the founder of pharmaceutics.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Wu has more than 20 years of work experience in the pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp; She has been leading the development and manufacturing of injectable drug products at various development stages, including preclinical, clinical, New Drug Application (NDA) registration, and commercial launch.&nbsp; In her talk, Dr. Wu shared what is critical for CMC development to achieve successful new drug approval.&nbsp; She also shared the exciting and challenging aspects of the developed anticancer and antibiotic drug products.&nbsp; After her talk, Prof. Schloss asked two questions: “Do you hire pharmacists at Celcuity, Inc?” and “Do they need to know chemistry?”&nbsp; The answer to both questions was: “Yes.”&nbsp; Pharmacy students have career opportunities beyond working in a retail pharmacy.&nbsp; Former students working in retail pharmacy for more than ten years frequently express disappointment at the routine nature of this kind of work.&nbsp; The ability of these students to go on to other jobs they find to be more fulfilling depends, in many cases, on a solid foundation in the basic sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/14.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-19537"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/14.jpg"" alt="""" width=""391"" height=""220"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/14.jpg 391w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/14-300x169.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px""></a></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Frontline healthcare workers were essential during the COVID-19 pandemic to assist in caring for the weak and to minimize people’s symptoms, with the hope of delaying the spread of the illness. The healthcare system’s significant challenges were evident in the overflow at hospitals, clinics, and urgent care centers as well as the numerous deaths that occurred there. Even paramedics, EMTs, firefighters, and many other people working in mental healthcare are worn out as a result of the pandemic.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Because of the perceived increased responsibility, many people have quit or will leave their profession in due time. Many more people will have experienced significant mental distress and lost the strength to help save lives. These include those who worked behind the scenes, such as psychiatrists and social workers, in addition to frontline personnel. They are also experiencing burnout, including dissatisfaction, tiredness, and the sense that they have nothing more to give.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Compassion fatigue frequently manifests as trouble concentrating, a lack of job satisfaction, pessimism, dread or avoidance, and irritation at work. Though equally debilitating, this is seldom talked about. Longer workdays and an increase in workload could cause imbalances between work and personal life. It might potentially result in an unhealthy work environment. Therefore, the exhaustion and loss of compassion of the healthcare professionals may translate into a loss of excitement and care apathy. The emotional need of helping others is lessened, and empathy is at an all-time low. In the end, this could result in cognitive impairment, poor judgment and conduct, loneliness, sadness, PTSD (</span><span data-contrast=""none"">posttraumatic</span><b><span data-contrast=""none""> stress disorder)</span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">, and even despair amongst healthcare workers.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Offering webinars and seminars, promoting wellness programs, and creating a happy work atmosphere are some methods to help all healthcare employees. Therapists and nutritionists place a strong emphasis on good habits and hydration. A positive culture with increased employee engagement may result from improved communication, support, and prevention, which will build trust. Assisting the community and society to return to normal will be a difficult task for years to come</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">By Maria Shearing, BSN, RN, PHN</span></b><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Throughout the era of the coronavirus pandemic, variants have continued to emerge, as the SARS-COV-2 continues to mutate and evolve. In November 2021, a new variant of the coronavirus emerged. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the variant omicron, which was later termed as “a variant of concern (VOC)” (He et al., 2021). According to Goga et al. (2021), omicron significantly infects a larger number of healthcare workers (HCW) aged between 18 and 30 years, compared to those aged 55 years and above. As a student nurse in the Master’s program (MSC), one should adhere to the measures undertaken by the institution to mitigate the risk of the omicron variant.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Also, those who are asymptomatic or with resolving symptoms should continue wearing masks for another five days when in public to minimize the risks of infecting other people with the variant. The directives have been motivated by the scientific discovery that most SARS-COV-2 transmission happens in the early stages of the illness, that is, around 1-2 days before the symptoms emerge, and 2-3 days after the emergence of symptoms.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The directives by the CDC will benefit students who have tested positive for omicron, as well as those who want to do practicum experience as healthcare workers (HCWs) in various hospitals and clinics. Both students and staff members of the American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) have been encouraged to go for testing within the institution, as a way of keeping the omicron variant outside the institution. Planning for taking the test, choosing a testing site at a convenient place, and making the process fast, can encourage people to take the test (Anthes, 2021). Our institution’s leadership has scheduled and offered free testing onsite to encourage students to be tested for the variant to follow the guidelines imposed by the CDC and, most importantly, to keep everyone safe.&nbsp; Those who are found positive, both students and staff, should follow the guidelines, isolate, and retest after the fifth day, as well as wear an appropriate and well-fitting mask and then return to campus when asymptomatic.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There is a lot that the world has yet to learn about omicron, but students should protect themselves from the variant by wearing high-quality masks, including those rated FFP2 and FFP3, as they are considered more protective compared to cloth masks. Several vaccines, which include Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, including boosters, have been approved by WHO to mitigate the risk of contracting the variant (Shekhar et al., 2021). In addition, hand-washing and social distancing are other responsibilities for preventing the variant.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Dr. Jey Pillai is joining the School of Pharmacy’s academic faculty with “one goal in mind to promote advanced clinical pharmacy practice in a student-centered concept to not just teach theory but show how to transition from ‘theory to practice.’”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Pillai goes on to say that parity, equity and equality in Health Care and Education are central to humanity and its progress. A lack of opportunity in education is one social determinant that leads to health disparities that are preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health care which are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations. AUHS is uniquely positioned, serving Signal Hill/Long Beach, CA, to address this issue focusing on the underserved population in medical education, providing opportunities to educate, train and produce health care experts. These health care graduates, clinical pharmacists, nurses and others help fill the void in the community. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">He concludes by noting that AUHS’s stand for diversity, affinity, inclusion and tolerance is applaudable; supporting diversity that attracts talents from different walks of the human race, enhances creativity through different thought processes on issues, topics and research projects with better out-comes finally strengthening and benefiting communities. He is excited to join the AUHS faculty and to impart and share his many years of practical experience in clinical pharmacy practice to prepare today’s students for tomorrow to face their clinical duties with confidence and compassion.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Likewise, the Bible encourages us to have right beliefs which will enable us to deal with worry.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Here are some classic verses which should enable us to deal with worrisome thoughts:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">Don’t worry about anything, but pray about everything. With thankful hearts offer up your prayers and requests to God. </span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">Philippians 4:6 CEV</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">“If you decide for God, living a life of God-worship, it follows that you don’t fuss about what’s on the table at mealtimes or whether the clothes in your closet are in fashion. There is far more to your life than the food you put in your stomach, more to your outer appearance than the clothes you hang on your body. Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">“Has anyone by fussing in front of the mirror ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion—do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wildflowers. They never primp or shop, but have you ever seen color and design quite like it? The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">“If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers—most of which are never even seen—don’t you think he’ll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you? What I’m trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with getting, so you can respond to God’s giving. People who don’t know God and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don’t worry about missing out. You’ll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span data-contrast=""none""> </span></i></b><i><span data-contrast=""none"">“Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> Matthew 6: 25-34</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death?</span></i><b><i><span data-contrast=""none""> </span></i></b><i><span data-contrast=""none"">(As the Scriptures say, “For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.”)</span></i><b><i><span data-contrast=""none""> </span></i></b><i><span data-contrast=""none"">No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> Romans 8: 35-39</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Let me draw your attention to a few points about how to apply these verses when we are tempted to worry: what to do instead, what to remember, and what to value.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">What to do instead of worrying. If I tell you not to think about green monkeys, what are you thinking about? Similarly, if I say don’t worry about your test or inflation, what are you thinking about? Instead, pray about your test and inflation (not sure about the green monkeys, but they do fall into the category of everything). Prayer is better than worrying because you are getting help with the problem. Of course, the problem may be you (or me)!</span><span data-contrast=""none""><sup>5</sup></span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">What to remember: God’s faithfulness. God cares about us. God know are needs. If we commit to God, God will commit to caring for us. A pastor, named George Muller decided (after seeking God’s will) to run an orphanage by only asking God to meet their needs, never a request to a person. While there were times that they had no money, money or food always showed up at the last minute for the next meal.</span><span data-contrast=""none""><sup>6</sup></span><span data-contrast=""none""> Remember how God has shown His care for you, and trust that He will continue to do so.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">What to value. What is most valuable to you? If your answer is the love of God, then you can never, ever lose that. If your answer is something else, then you have a bigger problem than worry – idolatry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">So, when you get sticker shock at the pump, when your text book seems to be all hieroglyphics, when it looks like your treasure is in danger, memorize, meditate on, and pray these words of scripture, and take a deep breath. In the words of Julian of Norwich:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">For our voices project, we had the opportunity to interview Joshua. Shanika met him at work, in a detox center where he was a guest speaker. He agreed to do an interview through zoom with us to share his story. We scheduled an interview with him on Sunday, August 28, 2022 at noon.&nbsp; He shared with us his life story and the difficult times he faced in the past. In our interview, we asked him how he was able to get basic services, necessities, and what help he received to overcome those difficult times. He shared how he was feeling and how he overcame not only the physical challenges, but the mental challenges as well. His story is one of overcoming obstacles and finding purpose in life. He also had a theme of forgiveness and accepting the mistakes he committed. Through his story we learned that God could change anyone’s life and it does not matter how deep the hole is, God can get you out of the situation.&nbsp; We started by asking him to tell us a little bit about himself. He responded by saying that his name is Joshua, and he is thirty years old. He mentioned that life is good, but it was not always good. He said that he is now four years clean from heroin and meth. He also had been in and out of jail throughout his life, mostly in Michigan. His family background, as he shared, was one of drugs. His mom got sober when he was eight. He started to use drugs when he was thirteen or fourteen and earned 7 felonies. He said during the time when he was using drugs, he did not care how he got his “fix.” He mentioned he would rob people, steal cars, and break into people’s houses. He said he knew that what he was doing was wrong, but he didn’t think that he would be able to become a good person. He said he believed he would live a life of a junkie. The hardest part he had to face in life was believing that he was a good person and that he could change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-5,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:479}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

We wanted to know how he obtained basic services including medical, dental, shelter, and food. We asked him if he ever needed some type of medical assistance. He mentioned that during that time when he was in the state of Michigan, he had the basic medical plan given through the state, but in 2015 he was cut off. He told us that he did not care about receiving basic services because he knew how to “work the system.” He knew that if he needed shelter, food, or health services, he could go to the state shelters or inpatient programs to receive it. Since he was more focused on drugs, he did not worry about his health or wellbeing, and he mentioned that he was ok with the idea of dying. He said he was a “frequent flier” with the ambulance company because he was known for overdosing. He said in 2016 he was in the hospital about 7 times for overdoses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-5,&quot;335559731&quot;:50,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:479}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">In 2014 Joshua was forced by court to go to a yearlong Christian based program that was connected to the local homeless shelter, and it was completely free. This program was called Men’s Life Recovery program. During the first 90 days of the program, he was considered an inpatient meaning that in the beginning of the program they do not give you as much freedom. As time passes, he started to get a little more freedom. After the first 90 days in the program, he was able to get a job and pay 10% of his paycheck back to the shelter. After he completed this program in 2015, he rented a house from one of his family members and he got a roommate. He stayed sober for about six months and was doing well. After six months he went back to doing and selling drugs and as a result, lost the house he was renting. Eventually, this life of crime caught up to him and he went back to jail around the end of 2015 where he was forced to get clean again. He mentioned that from that time forward he was going in and out of jail through 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-5,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:479}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">&nbsp;In those years where he was going in and out of jail, he experienced homelessness but was not living on the streets. He would go to different hotels every three days due to being paranoid that he would get caught having drugs on him. We asked if he was able to live with his family instead of hotel hopping. He responded by saying that his mom gave him an ultimatum. His mom told him he could only move back in with her if he completed a 90-day rehab program, but he did not want to. He was content with hotel hopping. He liked spending some nights here and there. For him, it was interesting. During this time, he was not ready to give up who he thought he was. He later faced a real challenging time in life where his girlfriend passed away from an overdose. This was a turning point in his life where his friend offered him an opportunity to get better. This is when he came to Los Angeles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-5,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:479}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Coming to Los Angeles was a life changing decision for Joshua. We were able to speak about the decision he made to change his life around in Los Angeles. How everything transpired in his process to his recovery. After his girlfriend overdosed and passed away, Joshua was at a very low point in his life. He tried to intentionally overdose twice and survived. After that point a really good friend of his offered to help him. He asked Joshua if he wanted to change his life around. Joshua knew that was his turning point and accepted the help. His friend flew him to Los Angeles to a private program where he could get clean. This program was a sober living and outpatient program. The program would normally take private insurance, but Joshua had a full scholarship. Before he flew to Los Angeles his friend also gave him some cash to sustain his basic needs for the first few weeks in L.A. In the program he was given food and basic necessities. Within two weeks of being in the program he was able to obtain a “get a well job” where he worked at a wings place in Hollywood to provide himself with basic necessities. In this program he also learned through other members that he could apply for Medi-Cal, food stamps, and cash aid. Through that program Joshua was able to get back on his feet, clean, and become a member of society again. After one year of being sober, he became the house manager at the sober living and decided to work in treatment. He said that working in treatment gave him a taste of what it is to help others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-5,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:479}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Lastly, we asked Joshua about the changes he has made in his life. He told us that he is now a drug and alcohol counselor at a rehab/mental health facility where he enjoys giving back to the community he was once a part of. He attributes his success with sobriety to his faith and belief in God. He believes in his heart that there is no other reason besides God that he is alive today after experiencing so many overdoses. He now says that he realizes that he has a higher purpose in life and no longer wonders if he is a good person. He made a joke that he went from&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:14,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:70,&quot;335559740&quot;:474}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">“robbing people to helping people” and “putting people on their knees to getting on his, in prayer.” He says the program was a complete blessing. He still uses the tools he learned while in treatment and shares his story with those who need inspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:5,&quot;335559731&quot;:710,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559740&quot;:479,&quot;335559991&quot;:10}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Reaffirmation Visit held on July 27, 28, &amp; 29, 2022</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>After its five (5) years of initial accreditation, American University of Health Sciences was scheduled for a&nbsp;Reaffirmation Visit held on July 27, 28, &amp; 29, 2022. &nbsp;Preparation towards the reaffirmation required all schools – leadership, faculty, and staff – commitment to ensure that we present quality and substantive evidence-based outcomes of our performance as an institution.</p>
<p>There were 17 standards divided into Accreditation requirements and Federal requirements.&nbsp; Listed below are the components under each standard. Each component has sub-components that we, as an institution need to demonstrate continued compliance since our initial accreditation.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Board of Trustees, Senior Executive Administration, I would like to extend our sincerest appreciation to all of you, and to those who participated in the interview with the evaluators. All schools were represented in this interview including students and alumni.&nbsp; We express special appreciation to Gregory Tillman who willingly took care of the transportation driving, and Ivy Javaluyas for seamless coordination of the TRACS visit.</p>
<p>At this reaffirmation visit, we demonstrated and exemplified our institutional traits of collaborative efforts, one mindset and one goal – and so I end this report with my adopted theme of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>We work as one, we hold the line, and we do not break!!</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With God’s blessings, we are graced with an abundance of opportunities to be the greatest university in the world (from prayer of Pastor Gregory Johnson, Cofounder).</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The jailer fell trembling at the prisoner’s feet. There, unshackled, stood Paul and Silas, arrested for the crime of setting a slave free from demonic oppression. Now the jailer asked, “What must I do to be saved?” A few minutes ago, he had been sound asleep, oblivious to the sounds of singing from the nearby jail. Then had come the earthquake – so severe that all the doors had been opened and somehow all the chains had come loose as well, but instead of escaping the prisoners were all in place. The jailer must have heard something about the Way, or maybe he just was afraid of people who could cause earthquakes. At any rate, he asked the right question.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As my body lies in the cold, dark tomb, I cannot help but feel optimism. It has been a long four days and I have almost given up hope. Never did I think I would be in this position. I have left my sisters behind and now they weep for me. They are sad I am not by their side, but in my head, I knew I would find my way back to them once again. I knew my love for Jesus and almighty God would guide me during my darkest times. Even when I lay on my death bed and my sisters called for Jesus, my hope and faith never wavered.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As Jesus and his disciples made their way to me in Judea, my body could no longer take the illness. My body had broken down, but my soul did not leave this earth, for I knew that Jesus was coming. I knew that if I kept my faith and believed in him, then there would be no death, only salvation. It is an odd feeling being able to walk and roam the earth while no one can see you or hear you. There were moments I saw my sisters sad as they cried because of my death. I wanted to come to them and comfort them to let them know: “I have not left your side. I am with you in spirit and will once again be with you in the flesh.” I wanted to tell them to be patient and have faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">I could tell the faith of Mary and Martha was dwindling as they had no idea what to expect of Jesus. Once the word got to them that Jesus was arriving, Martha went straight to meet him. She knew what this meant. She knew there was still hope for my life. The fact that Jesus had returned, knowing how the Jews had once treated him in this town, showed how much he loved me and my sisters. I believe that Martha felt the same way as she was eager to come to him. Mary was struggling with all that was going on and was less enthusiastic about the Lord’s visit. She waited at home in sorrow, only thinking of the present and my death. I would watch over her, thinking that she just needs a small glimmer of hope.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">I knew once Jesus arrived that everything would change and so it did. Mary eventually got out of the house and went to see Jesus. I watched her fall to her feet in front of Jesus and beg for his help. He said to them, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; And whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?” (John 11). This message from Jesus to my sister was to instill belief and faith in her that everything will be okay as long as one believes in him. All I could hope was that my sisters believed in Jesus as much as I do, for he loves us so much. As Jesus made his way to the tomb, I knew the time had come for him to turn non-believers into believers. As Jesus asked where I lay, my sister stopped him and said my body would have a wicked stench due to the amount of time I was dead. I rolled over in my grave as I could not believe that the first thought my sister had was going to be about my body odor. At that point Jesus asked to be led to the tomb where I lay. He ordered that the rock covering my body be moved immediately. Jesus then said aloud “Lazarus, come out!” (John 11). I started to have feeling in my fingers and my toes, and a sudden surge of energy flew through my body. My eyes opened, and the joy and relief I felt was unimaginable. I knew that Jesus had saved me, and I would finally be reunited with my family.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Living with Alzheimer’s disease is a continuing daily struggle that includes both good and bad days. People who once found joy in their lives are now confronted with difficulties such as forgetfulness, memory loss, or impaired cognition. The inability to care for oneself might have an impact on a patient’s health. Caregivers have the responsibility to continuously show their loved ones affection and care. Not only is social isolation concerning, but the stigma of having such an illness may have a significant impact on people’s health. People can keep their independence with changes in the early stages of the condition, which is a significant event that alters one’s life.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">At first, there should be no assumptions regarding significant function, behavior, or cognition changes. Having a daily routine can assist a person to stay focused and attentive. People can be quite independent at most of the initial, non-severe stages. Alzheimer’s patients will experience the disease in various ways. Even though a person’s needs are different from those of another person with dementia, we should accept and acknowledge how each person feels. It can be difficult to recognize this shift in routine at times but learning to adjust can be the key to giving personalized care. Engaging with everyone normally can be of great value even if it takes them longer to react or they repeat themselves; they still need and want to connect and feel included. Assisting everyone with patience in speech, movement, and recall can be comforting.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Everyone has good and bad days, but for those living with dementia, having an “off” day means having difficulty with daily tasks. People can always validate a person’s efforts to succeed and recognize that some chores or conversations may need to be continued later. Daily experiences are to be made as valuable as possible. Those days that are less valuable should be considered as adequate and not to be ashamed of. Denial and fear of Alzheimer’s disease are frequently harmful. Therefore, understanding the development of the disease and the decline in mental capacities may lead to greater acceptance. We must all contribute to coping skills and show understanding since ignorance about the condition may result in uncomfortable conversations and decisions</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Although, some students may see nursing school as painful, we have to remember that GOD will always see us through it, and it’s true that where two or more are gathered in the name of Jesus, he hears our prayers and moves mountains! Praise the LORD for his abundance, and grace over us. May He continue to bless LADMC and LADMC foundation as they are blessings to many in the community they serve and others. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This month is the 10</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">th</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> anniversary of Venus’s joining AUHS to serve our students by helping them obtain financial aid for their future. Venus grew up with four older brothers who continue to look out for their little sister even though she was trained by her father to be quite independent. The value that shaped her most as child was perseverance. She immigrated to Canada in 2002 and to the US in 2010.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Venus has a BS in Accountancy and an MS in Management and Leadership. She came to AUHS in 2012 because of its diversity and mission to serve God and the community by providing quality healthcare. In her spare time, she enjoys time with her son and taking him to sports activities and traveling as a family.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This month we celebrated the 20th&nbsp;anniversary of one of our core colleagues: Ivy Javaluyas. Ivy, for the few who don’t know her, is the Executive Director of Student Affairs which pretty much includes everything in the university outside of classes. Pastor Johnson and Ms. Kim have a lot of stories about her – all of them about how she has gone above and beyond for the university in the toughest of times.</p>
<p>Ivy’s story begins in San Pablo City, Philippines where her close-knit family put God at the center (like AUHS!).&nbsp; She is the oldest of three sisters. Her father is a lawyer, and her mother is an English teacher. She received her BS in Mathematics (Actuarial Science) and went on for an MS in Management and Leadership.</p>
<p>In 2002, Ivy was hired as the registrar for the then American Institute of Health Sciences. She was drawn here by the mission of the school, and she has been a strong supporter of the American University of Health Sciences Foundation participating in most of their programs.</p>
<p>Ivy enjoys travelling with her husband and family, exploring food and culture of any new place she visits. Although most of her family is far away, she looks forward to being reunited with them this Christmas.</p>
<p>Her dream for AUHS is to expand globally with many more programs. No wonder, Ivy Javaluyas deserves this month’s spotlight. Although one of a kind, we need many more like her!</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One of the most often neglected, but possibly life-saving, phone numbers is the Poison Control Center’s national phone number, 1-800-222-1222. Over the years, many outpatient clinics and retail pharmacies have either forgotten (or did not realize) that this tool is available 24/7 and free of charge for their patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The National Poison Control Center toll-free number is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to provide free, expert, and confidential guidance in a poison emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When you call Poison Control, you will speak directly to a poison specialist who is a registered nurse or pharmacist. The poison specialist will ask you a few questions to determine the severity of your case, and then provide recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">After many years of training as a nurse or a pharmacist, a poison specialist takes one additional year of training. Then the poison specialists sit for a national certifying exam to become CSPIs (Certified Specialists in Poison Information). These specialists can take your call and provide expert medical guidance in poison emergencies 24 hours a day. You can also call with questions about poison, not just poison emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It is always a good idea to recommend to our communities and patients putting the National Poison Center’s toll-free number on their phone list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In the late 1960s, Michael Scriven first coined the terms “formative” and “summative” in the context of program evaluation. In 1968, Benjamin Bloom expanded on these concepts to include formative assessment as a component of the teaching-learning process. According to Bloom, the purpose of formative assessment was to provide feedback and allow for correction at any stage in the learning process. Subsequently, the definition of formative assessment expanded to include evidence of student achievement which would be used by educators and learners to make decisions about instruction that would be evidence based as opposed to anecdotal.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Formative assessment should be used for improvement rather than making final decisions. Formative assessment can provide information which can be used to make immediate changes in teaching and learning and in the program. The primary differences between formative and summative assessments are where they occur in the teaching/learning process and what the outcome of that information is used for. Usually, summative assessment happens at the end of the teaching-learning process, while formative assessment occurs during that process. Information obtained from formative assessment can be used to affect the instructional experience on an immediate basis based on student feedback. As summative assessments occur at the end of the teaching-learning process, information obtained that might improve the process cannot be applied until the next time the course is offered again.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Formative assessment can occur in Student Learning; Interprofessional Education; and Faculty Teaching. A variety of formative assessment techniques can be applied in didactic or experiential settings to improve student knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Formative feedback of instructors helps develop faculty and improves the quality of teaching. Formative assessment allows for a safe place for faculty to experiment and students to learn without the sword of failure hanging over them.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">By Jasen Chau, PharmD, APh.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. Even though it has been shown that becoming older is the main risk factor for the disease, its cause is still unknown. The care of this neurologic disorder is challenging because no curative medications have been discovered. The only way to combat the disease is to try to minimize its neurological consequences and symptoms. The main risk factor for sporadic AD is aging as it causes proteinopathies. Other common risk factors include midlife depression, poor education level, obesity, midlife hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The prodromal stages of AD may start up to 10 or even 15 years before clinical diagnosis. In general, AD patients reported more pain in the early stages of the disease than those in a more advanced stage of the disease.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The pathophysiology of AD can be explained by the amyloid hypothesis, which has also directed much research into successful therapies. The APP (amyloid precursor protein) is broken down into peptide Aβ (beta-amyloid) by proteolysis. Aducanumab (Aduhelm, Biogen) is the first antibody, indicated for the treatment of AD, being highly selective of the Aβ aggregate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the indication in July 2021 to patients with moderate cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in whom treatment was started in clinical studies. There is clear evidence that this antibody reduces the amyloid burden in amyloid PET scans, and it may also have some positive effects on cognitive and functional abilities. However, because clinical trials produced mixed results regarding the drug’s efficacy, the FDA approval of it in June 2021 is seen as controversial. Some clinicians state that the medicine promotes false hope. The approval was criticized for having insufficient evidence of efficacy, and the high price will negatively affect patient finances and Medicare spending.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Lecanemab, another “anti-amyloid” monoclonal antibody medication being collaboratively researched by pharmaceutical companies Biogen and Eisai, was given fast-track approval by the FDA in June 2021. Fast-tracking allows the FDA to assess the drug more quickly but does not equate to approval. Despite the controversy with aducanumab, the FDA’s decision to grant lecanemab “priority” status suggests that there is still a possibility that the agency would expedite additional medications under development that are similar. Regarding the future of medication development for AD, this new immunotherapies-focused drug development method raises important concerns, including those pertaining to ethics, economics, biomarkers, social consequences, and longer clinical trials involving AD patients and their families. Every older patient needs to undergo a comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment. </span>Enhancing the concept of “healthy aging” is essential, in the end.</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">     There has been a recent increase in the COVID-19 infection rate within Los Angeles County. It is so evident even on our own campus. We have had staff, faculty, and students who reported respiratory symptoms caused directly by the COVID-19 virus. According to the LA County Public Health website, as of July 22, 2022, there were 8,091 new cases reported. The total cases reported are 3,253,323.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Jesus used many word pictures to help us understand life in the Kingdom of God — which is simply living life in dependence on God. One of those images is of a yoke of oxen.

How can Jesus’ yoke give us rest from heavy burdens? The key is understanding who we are yoked with. When we are yoked with Jesus, most of the burden is on Him. If you are bearing a heavy burden, yoke up with Jesus, learn from him how to carry it (with Him in charge), and you will feel lighter.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">A rare infectious viral disease which is prevalent in Central and West African nations recently was found in the USA in May 2022. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> this disease is caused by the monkeypox virus</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> (MPV or MPXV)</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">, a member of the </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Orthopoxvirus</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> genus in the family </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Poxviridae.</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> The MPV is a double-stranded DNA virus transmitted from animal-human (zoonotic) through contact with the blood, bodily fluids, cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals. Human-to-human transmission is possible although limited. The incubation period of the virus usually ranges from 6-13 days. The signs and symptoms include fever, intense headache, swelling of the lymph nodes, back pain, muscle aches, exhaustion, and rashes, lasting for 2-4 weeks. Lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes) during the early stage of illness may be a clinical feature distinguishing monkeypox from chickenpox or smallpox. The vulnerability was found to be higher in children than adults, but with the global eradication of smallpox and the cessation of the vaccine, the probability is almost the same. The diagnosis of this disease may be confirmed through laboratory testing and lesion samples. Currently, according to Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), no specific treatments are </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">available for monkeypox infection, but smallpox vaccine, cidofovir, ST-246, and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) can be used to control a monkeypox outbreak. The current outbreak heightens the need for continued research to come up with strategies to reduce the spread of an outbreak in the future.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">By Jasen Chau, PharmD, APh.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;Any type of dementia may cause memory loss as a symptom and this loss of memory is common in patients with dementia. It is one of the early indicators of Alzheimer’s disease for many people. Dementia is caused by brain damage which can disrupt parts of the brain involved in memory creation and retrieval. Everyone is affected differently by memory loss, although many people with dementia may experience some of the following symptoms: inability to retrieve names of persons and objects, forgetting recent discussions or occurrences, finding it difficult to use the proper word in a conversation, misplacing or losing items (such as keys or eye glasses), being disoriented in familiar settings or on familiar journeys, forgetting how to perform routine chores (such as making a cup of tea), forgetting appointments or anniversaries, being unable to keep track of medications and whether or not they have been taken, and having difficulty recognizing familiar faces.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Memory can be affected in a variety of ways such as being unable to make new memories. Recent experiences are not “recorded” in the person’s memory and hence can’t be remembered later. A person may forget a recent conversation, requiring more time to retrieve knowledge. While the person is still able to recollect information, it takes considerably longer time, or they may require prompting. For example, they might take longer time to locate the name of an object because they are unable to retrieve information. This indicates that, while the person can produce new memories, they are unable to access them when they are needed.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

On the other hand, people with dementia may be able to recall activities that they have done many times before, such as their journey to school or events with strong emotional significance. This includes abilities like playing a musical instrument or driving that require a lot of practice. More emotional events, such as weddings or birthday parties, may be remembered by people with dementia. Memory also contains an emotional component. In dementia, this emotional memory is frequently damaged considerably later. Even if a person with dementia has forgotten the details of an event, they may remember how they felt about it. They may not recall where they went on vacation or when a buddy came to visit, but they may still be glad about it later. The senses, such as hearing a certain piece of music or smelling a certain aroma, can evoke this emotional recollection. These changes may be more noticeable to family and friends than they are to the individual. Older memories are more securely entrenched than newer memories because they have been recalled or discussed more frequently. While a person with dementia may forget recent experiences, they can recall precise recollections from a previous episode.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Understanding the brain and how it changes can aid in understanding dementia symptoms. It can assist a person with dementia in living well or provide support to a person with dementia who is living well. Memory issues will become more chronic in a person with dementia, and it will begin to influence daily living. This can be tough to deal with, both for the individual and for those who care for them. There is, however, support to assist a person with dementia in managing their memory impairments, thus helping the patient remain independent for longer periods of time.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The word “stress” is very often used, especially during and after the pandemic created by COVID-19.&nbsp; Some of us who have been deeply involved in stress research and education often feel that “stress” is frequently implicated inappropriately, i.e., instead of using a specific expression like being tired, frustrated or disappointed. Precisely, scientifically, ‘stress is the nonspecific response of the body on any demand made upon it’, as it was originally defined by its discoverer, Hans Selye 4-5 decades ago. Actually, the last three PhD students of Hans Selye (Profs. Yvette Tache, UCLA; Arpad Somogyi, Hungarian Academy of Sciences and yours truly, me) in 2013 started a series of annual conferences for the better understanding of the biologic stress concept, its neuroendocrine mechanisms as well as stress-related diseases and their management.&nbsp; These Summer Schools on Stress (SSS) were held in several countries of Europe, in Japan, Russia and, the first time that it was organized in the USA, at the American University of Health Sciences (AUHS).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">At this conference, held at AUHS on June 13-14, 2022, after the greetings and introductory remarks by AUHS President Dr. Carol Ryan and Provost Dr. Marilyn Uvero, not only five members of SSS international core faculty made presentations (namely, Profs. Bruno Bonaz, France; Ludmila Filaretova, Russia; Oksana Zayachkivska, Ukraine; Sandor Szabo, USA), but also several faculty members of the AUHS Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy gave very nice overview of topics related to stress and the stressor aspects of COVID-19. The AUHS presenters included Drs. Gerald Maguire, Grant Lackey, John Schloss and Pantelina Zourna-Hargaden (</span><a href=""https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphotos.app.goo.gl%2FtPBvyLqfDZ3RiCk16&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csszabo%40auhs.edu%7Caec6682e07bb46312b9908da541627bd%7Cc00b55f0977641b79090678b339b494c%7C0%7C0%7C637914751384213938%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=kDymnVeOjHH2HJio32saDEMMmGwdPhqL5bnp9Jm2qHg%3D&amp;reserved=0""><span data-contrast=""none"">https://photos.app.goo.gl/tPBvyLqfDZ3RiCk16</span></a><span data-contrast=""auto""> ).

<p><span data-contrast=""auto""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-19335"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""344"" height=""258"">One of the interesting features of the conference has been that it connected the basic, historic observations of Hans Selye on animal models of severe distress, with the review of stress-related disease, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). At the end of the conference, mental health issues caused or exacerbated by COVID-19 were presented and discussed. COVID-19 adversely affected millions of people not only by physical disease, but by fear of infection, depression, anxiety, esp., during isolation.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Because of the multifaceted presentation of COVID-19, especially the ‘long COVID syndrome’ (LCS), and based upon multifactorial mechanisms, it is not surprising that a ‘post COVID-19 stress syndrome’ has also been recognized. Furthermore, COVID-19 has been recognized as the largest new human stressor. These stressors include not only the causative virus, but the severity of the disease, and the personal, psychosocial suffering. The ‘post COVID-19 stress syndrome’ can also be part of LCS and it is well defined by typical endocrine (e.g., initially elevated, then decreased secretion of cortisol, related to the exhaustion of the adrenal glands), and other metabolic changes.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Hence, although the stress syndrome was first described more than 80 years ago in animal models, social events at the beginning of the 21</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">st</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> century prove that stress, especially distress, is very relevant today. And we, humans, cause it and suffer from it, but it’s also our duty to study, better understand and prevent it by transforming it into eustress.&nbsp; Namely, as Hans Selye used say and write, ‘stress is the salt of life’ – we cannot avoid it, but we need to live with it by reducing the distress and expanding the positive aspects of the stress reaction, i.e., eustress.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Our university is in the city of Signal Hill; it is hard to hide a city on a hill. As the name implies, the Puva tribe of native Americans would signal other natives on Santa Catalina Island from this hill (</span><a href=""https://www.cityofsignalhill.org/218/History-of-Signal-Hill""><span data-contrast=""none"">https://www.cityofsignalhill.org/218/History-of-Signal-Hill</span></a><span data-contrast=""auto"">). If you want people to see your light, standing on a hill is a great way to do it — putting it under a basket not so much. That is why Jesus told his disciples that they were the light of the world; they should be like a city on a hill so that their good deeds would be visible to all (Matthew 5: 14-16). We are not to display our good works for our glory but for God’s, who enables us to do them to show His love for all people.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Along with the metaphor of light, Jesus told his disciples they were salt. Nowadays, salt is cheap, and we eat too much salt, but in the first century it was very precious — Roman soldiers were paid in salt. They were literally worth their salt. Salt represented the covenant between God and Israel (Leviticus 2:13; II Chronicles 13: 5). From these two images, comes the name of our campus ministry: </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Salt and Light</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

A disciple of Jesus is someone who has accepted Him as Savior and obeys His commands. Although, a student may not be a disciple, campus ministry will still seek to support him/her spiritually. Our lights, as disciples, shine brighter as we engage in personal and interpersonal spiritual disciplines. Some of the interpersonal disciplines we engage in at </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Salt and Light</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> are large group fellowship meetings to worship God and small groups to share more personally and study more in depth. Students are also encouraged to contact the </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Salt and Light</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> office for prayer and one-on-one discipleship.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Salt and Light</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> was started a few years ago by Dr. Mok Chong and some shining students like Maria Shearing, who is now a teacher at AUHS.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">On June 11, 2022, the AUHS Foundation hosted another </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Acts of Love</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> outreach to the community. Needy residents were blessed with fresh groceries. As food costs have soared in recent months, the turnout was greater than ever. One mother with three teenagers arrived without a voucher (vouchers are distributed by LBUSD school counselors and neighborhood social service agencies to families in need).&nbsp; Although the groceries were gone, and some families turned away due to the increased demand, the AUHS Foundation was able to give this family a gift card for groceries. Previously, this working mother had always been able to feed her children – and she, even at this point, did not want a handout; she wanted to do volunteer work in exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Pediatric medicine deals with the medical care of infants, children, and adolescents.  In the United States, this generally applies to children from birth to 18 years of age. The official change from pediatric to adult patients is age 21. The reason why the age is extended to age 21 is because many children are not quite ready to transition to adult medicine. It is beneficial for teenagers and young adults who have childhood illnesses such as leukemia, chronic health conditions, autism, intellectual and developmental delay, Down Syndrome, and many other pediatric medical concerns to be treated by a pediatrician and cared for by a pediatric nurse. This population benefits from the familiarity with and continuation of medical care by the same physician during the transition into adulthood.</p>
<p>The physiological and emotional differences that exist between adults and children require specialized training by pediatricians and pediatric nurses to be effective in meeting the health needs of young patients. The pediatric population is constantly maturing intellectually, emotionally, and socially―as well as physically.  Pediatric staff are challenged to deal with these changes effectively.  In the beginning of our pediatrics course, we teach our students to have good communication skills with this population due to the many different personalities and issues that come with pediatrics.  We learn to navigate through the challenges of emotional situations by preparing students to achieve better learning outcomes so as to provide the best possible care for this population of clients</p>
<p>We discuss growth and development along with physical assessment in the theory part of N350 which is a course in our BSN program. Then, we prepare the students for the clinical setting by learning the differences among the five categories of this population: infant, from birth to 12 months; toddler, 1 to 3 years of age; preschooler, 3 to 6 years; child, 6 to 12 years; and, adolescent, 13 to 18 years.</p>
<p>We learn in the theory, simulation, and clinical settings about the growth and development of all 5 groups.  Further, we learn the differences in vital sign parameters, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Students work on case scenarios in simulations where they are placed in small groups.  In these simulations, they research growth and development, proper nutrition, health issues, disease process, treatment regimens, school performance, teaching plans for children and their families, and dose calculations for this population of clients.</p>
<p>We have added five mathematics test questions to each examination.  Our goal for our students is to be at 100% in dose calculations. There is no room for medication error as it is the most common error in nursing practice.</p>
<p>Our students are assigned to this population in the clinical setting. While in this setting they will put theory into practice and be assigned to children with chronic respiratory lung disorders or with cerebral palsy having had a tracheostomy and being dependent on gastrostomy tube feedings. The students administer medications following safe practice protocols, and care for patients under supervision.</p>
<p>Students have observed clients at CHLA in compromised medical states. Students have worked in CTICU, medical surgical floor, hematology, oncology, and rehabilitation. Students will participate in medication administration, patient care, dressing changes, observe central line dressing changes, feeding by kangaroo pump via gastrostomy tube, procedures, and so much more. We aim for excellence in our program and will continue to find clinical sites for pediatrics that give our students exposure to medical practice following high standards and with guidance from highly qualified employees and staff so as to be one of the best schools of nursing in California.</p>

 BSN Student Volunteer Service,https://news.auhs.edu/bsn-student-volunteer-service/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SON-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<h1>Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Student Volunteer Service</h1>
<p>By Maria Shearing, BSN, Clinical Coordinator</p>
<p>Our Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students who are currently in Community Nursing Health, studying in our School of Nursing at the American University of Health Sciences located in Signal Hill, California, are acquiring some of their service hours by providing education and food to the homeless, volunteering at marathons (by setting up medical and hydration tents), at soup kitchens, and at the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>As we continue to progress and move forward into a new normal for the entire world post COVID-19. I must say that we have been blessed by the powerful hand of Christ.  We need to continue to stay focused in Him, on doing His great work and on not being afraid as He tells us in:</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 10:12-14 “God is faithful, and He will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing He will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.”</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite verses; He always sends us a way out.  Our nursing students were some of the very few who were not stopped from attending clinical during COVID-19, and as we are moving forward post COVID, we have found some programs that need volunteers to assist with feeding those who are underserved, or down on their luck.  Some of our BSN students have been blessed with an opportunity to educate God’s people with resources that are available to them within the community. Our students also have had the unique opportunity of completing a “windshield” survey; they basically see what it is like to be a part of the community they plan to work in. The idea is almost as if they are driving along and looking through the windshield at how many hospitals, schools and resources are available in that city.  The goal is that, at the end, they will be able to do this in the community where they will serve to better serve and know needs.  Our students are not only receiving an accredited BSN degree, they are volunteering with many different organizations: Beacon of Light, Pathway to Hope, American Red Cross, Doors of Hope, local marathons, and the LA Food Bank to name a few. Serving the underserved is key to our becoming the best nursing school in California.</p>

" Spotlight on Our New Librarian, Rachel Friedman",https://news.auhs.edu/spotlight-on-our-new-librarian-rachel-friedman/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rachel-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<p>Spotlight on Our New Librarian, Rachel Friedman </p>
<p>By Brent Davis, PhD </p>
<p>Ms. Rachel Friedman, Master of Management in Information and Library Science is the new librarian of AUHS, having started here at the beginning of April. She accepted this position because she saw the potential and niceness of the university.  </p>
<p>Rachel is a California native, born in the City of Angels, and as a child, many of her values were shaped by her family’s Orthodox Jewish faith. Her family is into reading and hiking, and Rachel additionally likes writing. As a librarian, I just had to ask who her favorite author was, and she replied that her favorite authors were Rabbis Aryeh Kaplan and Jonathan Sacks. Her aspiration is to “help students continue to improve their research and writing skills.” Rachel shines the light on research and we shine it on her. </p>

 Presentation on Trop2 as a Driver of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with Neuroendocrine,https://news.auhs.edu/presentation-on-trop2-as-a-driver-of-metastatic-prostate-cancer-with-neuroendocrine/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pharmacy-trops-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<p>Presentation on Trop2 as a Driver of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with Neuroendocrine Phenotype via PARP1  </p>
<p>By Dr Albert Ngo, PhD </p>
<p>Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) Division of Cancer Research and Training, Cancer Center, and Axis Center, under the leadership of Dr Jay Vadgama hosts a weekly cancer journal club presentation every Monday from 12:00PM-2:00PM PST. This weekly presentation is an excellent opportunity for the presenter to improve his/her critical appraisal skills with respect to peer-reviewed and published scholarly articles.  </p>
<p>It is from this perspective that Dr. Albert Ngo, Assistant Professor at the American University of Health Sciences, presented on the following article: “Trop2 is a Driver of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with Neuroendocrine Phenotype via PARP1,” Hsu, En-Chi, et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNSAS), 2020. The guest speaker, Dr Ngo, started off his presentation by providing a brief literature review. For instance, in 2020 a man died of prostate cancer every 16 minutes. Next, Dr. Ngo discussed the major findings from the research article published by Hsu, E.n-Chi, et al. They, among other points, demonstrated that tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Trop2) is a cell surface glycoprotein which has emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its overexpression in multiple epithelial cancers. The other major findings of this research article in the PNSAS are the following: (1) Trop2 drives neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, characterized by loss of luminal markers such as AR, expression of neuroendocrine markers, and elevated levels of PARP1; and (2) PARP1 inhibitors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic prostate cancer expressing elevated levels of Trop2. </p>

 The Divine Legacy of Nutritional Research Continuing at AUHS,https://news.auhs.edu/the-divine-legacy-of-nutritional-research-continuing-at-auhs/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pharmacy-LPA-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<p>The Divine Legacy of Nutritional Research Continuing at AUHS </p>
<p>By John Schloss, Ph.D. </p>
<p>Roger John Williams was a pioneer in 20th-century nutritional research. He discovered vitamins B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folic acid), lipoic acid, and the biotin-binding protein avidin. His brother, Robert R. Williams, was the first to synthesize thiamin (B1). Thiamin deficiency was responsible for 30% of the deaths in 1920s Japan.   </p>
<p>Roger (1893-1988) and Robert (1886-1965) were born in India (Ootacamund and Nellore, respectively) to Christian missionaries Robert and Alice Williams. It was in India that they first saw the effects of nutritional deficiencies. After his parents returned to the United States, Roger Williams grew up in Ottawa, Kansas (near where Dr. Schloss was a professor of pharmacy for 14 years) and Otay, California, where his father had a small pastorate. At the University of Texas, Austin, Roger later founded the Clayton Foundation Biochemical Institute (CFBI).  </p>
<p>CFBI became famous for many discoveries in the field of nutritional research.   </p>
<p>In the 1980s, one of the investigators at the CFBI, William Shive, developed a human lymphocyte-based assay to assess individual nutritional deficiencies. Unlike other dietary assessments, based on the levels of specific nutrients in the blood, the lymphocyte proliferation assay (LPA) could detect functional deficiencies originating from either genetic or dietary defects, assessing genetics and epigenetics simultaneously. Shortly after Dr. Shive invented the LPA method, Dr. Schloss had the good fortune to meet him during a visit to the University of Texas. It was immediately apparent how valuable the LPA would be in determining the relationship between nutrition and health for a single individual.   </p>
<p>Like Dr. Williams, Dr. Shive was a religious man. William (‘Billy’) Shive was active at the University of Texas, supporting the Religious Studies Program. Since meeting Dr. Shive in 1986, Dr. Schloss has included information about the LPA as part of his courses taught at five different pharmacy schools. Various investigators at AUHS (primarily led by Drs. Zeiler and Ngo) will set up and administer the LPA as part of our community outreach and research missions. Although the LPA has been commercially available since 1993, it continues to receive less attention and is less well known to healthcare providers than it should be. Unfortunately, Dr. Shive died in 2001 without completing much of the necessary research to validate the method.  </p>
<p>Researchers at AUHS plan to continue to develop this method and provide nutritional counseling and assessments to those in need, especially for those who are disadvantaged and to fight healthcare disparities prevalent among poorer communities.   </p>

 My GPS in My Early Professional Life,https://news.auhs.edu/my-gps-in-my-early-professional-life/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pharmacy-GPS-600x403.jpg,Trinium Newsletter,"<p>My GPS in My Early Professional Life </p>
<p>By Transon Nguyen, PharmD </p>
<p>We are all so proud of our inaugural class at the AUHS School of Pharmacy.  I’m fortunate to be able to share my GPS concept on navigating early professional life with many of our students. GPS is the Global Positioning System that most of us use to navigate our journeys. When coaching students on how to navigate their early professional lives, I tell them to use their GPS: G is for God, P is for Profession, S is for Service.  In my journey, whenever I made a wrong turn, my GPS would gently ‘recalculate’ and guide me back on to the appropriate path.   </p>
<p> “What do you use as your GPS?”  I ask my students.  “What do you use as your moral compass on your journeys?”   Taking it a step further, I challenge my students to substitute the word “moral” for any of the following terms: professional, ethical, spiritual, (and others).  I want my moral compass to sync with my professional, ethical, and spiritual compasses; I want this superimposed GPS to guide my journeys and personal and professional life decisions.  </p>
<p>I cannot change past mistakes from when I took wrong turns; I cannot change how anyone perceives or thinks of me. However, I have complete control over my actions in the present moment, and my actions will affect how my future unfolds. Life, or the universe, will unfold as it should. I do not have complete control over anything or anyone―except what I do right now.  Early in my life, my decisions were primarily based on emotions, often my reactions to life.  Anger, sadness, joy, fear, and all human emotions are normal and sometimes essential; they are parts of our lives. The key is to experience them, regulate them, and then let them go.  When I face difficulties, I simply ask myself, “where is God in this?” and the answer would eventually reveal itself.  </p>
<p>Professionally, I try not to react, no matter how any event unfolds, whether it is an accident, a misfortune, or any other unfavorable incident.  I can respond (if needed) as a professional, but I do not react.  When I didn’t know what to do, I would ‘pause’ and then reach out to my mentors and colleagues for proper advice; choosing not to respond is, in itself, a response.  When I am lost, it is ok to ask for directions, and it is ok to stay put until I figure out what to do.  It is also important to realize that sometimes I can only “just do the next right thing.”    </p>
<p>I ask my students not to be afraid of failure, to embrace vulnerability, and to trust their inner GPS. Most healthcare professions have their own various codes of ethics and professional oaths that can be used as foundations. A main part of AUHS’s mission is service. As a healthcare provider, I aim to serve others and from service arises humility, empathy, gratitude, and compassion.  </p>
<p>HOW to navigate professional challenges? Honesty, Open-mindedness, and Willingness to change and be better. When I’m lost or don’t know where to turn, I remember to use my GPS and make sure I have my spiritual and professional compass for guidance.      </p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><em>By Brent Davis, PhD&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Olga Vagin, our new Associate Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology at the School of Medicine, was born in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, now an independent state situated in the middle of Central Asia, but previously one of the 15 republics of the USSR. She hails from a family of scientists and researchers, mostly physicists and mathematicians, and her husband is also a mathematician. However, she is the first and, so far, the only biologist in her family. Olga has a daughter who has three children: two boys and one girl. They live in Northern California, so she and her husband are frequent travelers up and down I-5.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

In Central Asia she grew up in a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society, which developed in her an attitude of tolerance and openness to all people, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, or economic status. These values, no doubt, contributed to her joining AUHS because she loves the idea of a medical school that, not only gives students the knowledge required to become doctors, but also prepares them to make a difference in society and to provide healthcare to local, underserved communities. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">She dreams of involving interested AUHS students in her research projects which are focused on the role of membrane transporters and membrane cytoskeletal proteins in epithelial integrity (which depends on intercellular junctions, i.e., connections between neighboring cells). As someone whose epithelium’s integrity has suffered from too much sun, I am quite interested in the application of this research!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Finally, in her spare time, she loves reading, hiking, cooking, and traveling. She loves spending time with her family and friends. By friends she means real friends, not Facebook™ friends, and she values them highly. As an example, she meets with her high school classmates (who are all over the world) on a regular basis. Her last high school class reunion was right before the pandemic, in 2019, in Tbilisi, Georgia. She also stays in touch with her students, long after they have left her class.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">If you are over 50, if you are immune compromised or living with an immunocompromised person, then the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a second booster vaccination if your last booster was 4 months ago or longer. Separately, all adults who had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine are eligible for an mRNA vaccine which is either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Additionally, if it has been longer than 4 months since your Johnson and Johnson vaccination, the CDC recommends all adults receive an mRNA booster.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">COVID-19 started as an acute respiratory disease due to inhalation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and indeed most of the illnesses were of short duration (1).&nbsp; But as the pandemic spread around the world, complicated cases started to appear, i.e., some patients had long-standing respiratory problems, associated with fatigue, muscle weakness, and other signs or symptoms that are not typical of acute respiratory diseases which usually end quickly, and then patients recover. Clinicians were alarmed when they started to see returning patients who had completely recovered after acute COVID-19, but 4-8 weeks later came back, not only with breathing problems but severe, almost paralyzing fatigue, neurologic problems, headache, impaired memory labeled “brain fog,” as well as other organ dysfunctions, especially in the endocrine and gastrointestinal systems:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><em>The long-term effects of COVID-19.&nbsp; (Adapted from S. Lopez-Leon et al. More than 50 Long-term effects of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. medRxiv 2021 Jan 30;2021.01.27.21250617)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">When these long-duration cases started to appear in the scientific literature, they were labeled as ‘long-haulers,’ ’chronic COVID-19,’ ‘complicated COVID,’ etc., but the now prevailing designation seems to be ‘long COVD-19’ disease.&nbsp; However, this is not a simple ‘disease’ referring to the involvement of a single organ with a single lesion (e.g., infection or tumor). Rather, as discussed and illustrated above, this is a complex syndrome involving multiple organs with several lesions, constantly changing new or waning signs and symptoms. For these reasons, we prefer and propose to call it </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">‘long COVID-19 syndrome’ (LCS),</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto""> which is defined by at least two or three objective signs and subjective symptoms remaining (not disappearing) that are continuing four weeks after the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and acute COVID-19 disease. But since we now know that LCS may develop even in people who have had only a mild disease or had been asymptomatic after a proven infection by the virus, it is an important part of the definition that SARS-CoV-2 infection must be documented by PCR or antibody laboratory tests.&nbsp; Otherwise, as a large recent French study demonstrated (2), the label of LCS may lead to confusion and an unnecessary diagnosis of LCS – similar to the poorly understood and never objectively defined ‘chronic fatigue’ syndrome.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Because of the multifaceted presentation of LCS, based on multifactorial mechanisms, it is not surprising that a ‘post-COVID-19 stress syndrome’ has also been recognized (1, 3). Namely, since stress is defined by Hans Selye (4) as the ‘nonspecific response of the body to any demand upon it’ that, also by definition, must be caused by multiple factors (different in nature, e.g., biologic, chemical, psychosocial causative agents), COVID-19 is the greatest new human stressor. These stressors include not only the causative virus, but the severity of the disease, and the personal, psychosocial suffering (often associated with the frustration of isolation, loss of income, and death in the family, among others) (3).&nbsp; The ‘post-COVID-19 stress syndrome’ can also be part of LCS and it is well defined by typical endocrine (e.g., initially elevated, then decreased secretion of cortisol, related to the exhaustion of the adrenal glands), and other metabolic changes.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center""><em>(Adapted from S. Szabo and P. Zourna-Hargaden: COVID-19: New disease and the largest new human stressor. Integr. Physiol., 2020, 1, 258-265.)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">frequency of LCS</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto""> is variable in different populations, e.g., the initial prevalence in the U.S. was between 3-30%, but the most recent data from the U.K. indicate that 2.5% of the entire population experience various forms of LCS!&nbsp; Furthermore, the initial Israeli data showed that based on the self-reported vaccination status, fully vaccinated participants who had also had COVID-19 were 54% less likely to report headaches, 64% less likely to report fatigue, and 68% less likely to report muscle pain than were their unvaccinated counterparts (5).&nbsp;&nbsp; But the U.K. data revealed that, although prior vaccination offers some protection against LCS, LCS may still occur even in 25% of fully vaccinated people (6).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As for any complex disease, there is no way to predict who may develop LCS. This pessimistic prediction also stands for the </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">prevention and treatment</span></b> <b><span data-contrast=""auto"">of LCS</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">. But as we know from many multifactorial diseases, multivitamins, especially those with antioxidant potentials such as large doses of vitamins C and E as well as minerals such as selenium and zinc may also be beneficial. Furthermore, since many of the long-term complications of COVID-19 include vascular thrombo-embolic multiorgan lesions, small doses (e.g., 81 mg) of aspirin will likely be beneficial, as has just been demonstrated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (7).&nbsp; </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Thus, although “long COVID largely remains a mystery,” new clues are emerging (8) not only to its pathogenesis, i.e., mechanisms of development but also to its prevention and treatment. Nevertheless, more basic research is needed, as well as clinical and public health investigations, to fully elucidate the mechanisms and understand the manifestations of LCS.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">On April 7, 2022, the Financial Aid Department hosted a webinar to bring awareness to students and staff about the importance of good financial credit. Among the topics covered were FICO scores, financial health, identity theft, and credit reports, followed by a question-and-answer session. The presenter was from one of the two banks used by AUHS to provide student loans, and many found the presentation to be very helpful, especially the question-and-answer session afterward.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The AUHS School of Medicine (SOM) is pleased to announce that last Friday afternoon and evening the accreditation file, containing more than 300 pages, was submitted to the LCME (Liaison Committee for Medical Education of the American Medical Association) website. Our new SOM was administratively approved by WASC and TRACS, but before it can enroll students and begin classes, it requires accreditation from the LCME which approves the curricula of all medical schools in the USA and Canada. Our provost, Dr. Uvero wrote: “This afternoon we celebrate another milestone of submitting the SOM application for our Doctor of Medicine (MD) Program. It was a collaborative effort between the senior executive administration, Board of Trustees (Pastor and Ms. Kim Dang) and led/spearheaded by the SOM Leadership and faculty, Dean Dr. Szabo, Associate Dean Dr. Zourna, Dr. Nils Lambrecht, and contributing SOM faculty.” We give thanks to God for giving us the grace to achieve this milestone.<br>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">In their article on the neurological symptoms resulting from COVID-19, S. Spudich and A. Nath (“Nervous system consequences of COVID-19,” Perspectives, 20 January 2022, p. 267) highlight a need to understand the underlying pathophysiology. Following infection by SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of symptoms can persist for months, known as Long Covid (1). Neurological symptoms of Long Covid include anosmia (loss of smell), depression, and impaired cognition (1, 2). Localized zinc deficiency may explain COVID-19-induced anosmia (3, 4). Zinc therapy dramatically shortens the duration of COVID-19-induced anosmia, but not all other symptoms (5). The gene for the odorant-metabolizing enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is linked to anosmia and is dramatically elevated by low zinc (6, 7). Suboptimal zinc produces Th2 cytokines; down-regulates the olfactory-essential zinc-carbonic anhydrase; and lowers type 1 interferon expression without the need for viral destruction of olfactory neurons (3, 7, 8). Other neurological symptoms, such as impaired cognition and depression, are also associated with inadequate zinc levels (9, 10). Although insufficient zinc can play an essential role in COVID-19 disease, other vital nutrients are crucial to immune response and disease progression. Lack of either zinc or selenium correlate with the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection (11, 12). Up to 83% of individuals are deficient in two-or-more essential nutrients for lymphocyte-mediated immune response, 33% have inadequate zinc, and 25% of the general population lack five or more critical dietary factors (10, 13). Selenium, zinc, and other micronutrients are necessary to shorten the duration of Long Covid (14). Determining the importance of nutritional deficiencies should be a major focus in our quest to understand Long Covid.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">In addition to the health effects, many people are grappling with the huge emotional and sociological disruptions that the COVID-19 pandemic has created. According to healthcare professionals, many people are finding it difficult to adjust to a “new normal” now that lockdowns are beginning to ease. Many psychologists and psychiatrists have said that the unprecedented global health crisis has caused a rise in anxiety and depression, as well as exacerbating existing mental health disorders.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:823,&quot;335559739&quot;:159,&quot;335559740&quot;:258}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">The</span></i> <i><span data-contrast=""none"">Lancet</span></i><span data-contrast=""none""> medical magazine published an article in October 2021 looking at the global prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders in 204 countries and territories in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It discovered that mental health has worsened substantially, with an estimated 53 million new instances of major depressive disorder and 76 million new cases of anxiety disorders reported worldwide. Men and elderly adults were shown to be less affected than women and younger persons. Nevertheless, psychologists claim that during the initial six months of the virus’s emergence, there was a remarkable level of resilience, particularly when many countries went into unprecedented lockdowns.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:834,&quot;335559739&quot;:159,&quot;335559740&quot;:258}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Mask mandates, lockdowns, and a lack of social activities create a huge pressure cooker, especially for those who are already vulnerable. Many people were forced to face issues in their lives that they had previously been able to avoid, such as drinking, relationship problems, isolation, and loneliness. People who have been in stable relationships with their spouse appear to operate well. When people are stranded at home, though, they discover that there are a lot of things that they haven’t dealt with or noticed previously.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:629,&quot;335559739&quot;:159,&quot;335559740&quot;:258}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">According to data provided by Johns Hopkins University, there have been approximately 400 million COVID-19 cases worldwide, with over 5.7 million deaths. Millions of individuals have been unable to share not only life’s milestones, such as births and weddings, but also their final moments with loved ones, with many unable to hold or attend funerals during the most intense periods of lockdown.&nbsp; These painful events, such as being unable to visit sick or dying family due to constraints, have a profound impact. Bereavement, isolation, uncertainty, and loss – a loss of freedoms, relationships, and moments that cannot be relived and retrieved — are just a few of the concerns that have afflicted many people as the pandemic has increased anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:761,&quot;335559739&quot;:159,&quot;335559740&quot;:258}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">As society adapts and learns to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, new habits and acceptance will undoubtedly emerge. Most affluent countries with widespread vaccine coverage and booster programs are reopening and returning to normal, maybe including routine mask-wearing in high-risk areas and random COVID-19 testing for the foreseeable future. For a better, happier society, mental health should be at the forefront of healthcare services.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:768,&quot;335559739&quot;:162,&quot;335559740&quot;:258}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Kumar, MS, PhD, Assistant Professor, School of Pharmacy&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">A1AD is a hereditary disorder that commonly affects the lungs and liver and to a lesser extent the skin. It is characterized by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene (</span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">Ser</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">ine </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">P</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">rotease </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">In</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto"">hibitor), leading to low production of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), a protein that plays an essential role in the prevention of the breakdown of proteins. The most common mutations identified are termed as S (moderately low levels of A1AT) and Z (severe-very low levels of A1AT). A1AT is produced mainly in the liver and functions to protect the protein elastin of the lung alveoli from damage by the body’s own elastase enzyme. This problem is likely to result in an early onset of lung damage in cigarette smokers as it stimulates neutrophil influx into the lungs resulting in the oxidative inactivation of A1AT. A deficiency in A1AT thus results in an increased risk of emphysema, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and cirrhosis and fibrosis (due to entrapment of A1AT in the liver). Although A1AD accounts for 1-2 % of COPD cases affecting mostly Americans of Northern or Central European descent, most cases are undiagnosed. Symptoms of emphysema include </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">shortness of breath, chronic cough, phlegm production and wheezing. Symptoms related to liver abnormalities include </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">mildly elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, bleeding due to portal hypertension, and an abnormal accumulation of fluids within the abdominal cavity (ascites).  Cirrhosis eventually develops in up to 30-40% of individuals with a severe deficiency of A1AT, especially in individuals who do not have emphysema. A skin condition called as pa</span><span data-contrast=""none"">nniculitis (affecting the torso and extremities) seems to develop in only a few patients with A1AD. Pharmacological therapy regimen includes using standard medications like bronchodilators, corticosteroids, anticholinergics, and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Antibiotic therapy may be initiated in the case of respiratory infection. Non-pharmacological therapy regimen includes lung exercises, dietary nutrition and smoking cessation. Augmentation therapy is also recommended in cases of established emphysema that involves </span><span data-contrast=""none"">long-term infusion of purified, pooled human plasma derived A1AT. US FDA approved and available drugs include </span><span data-contrast=""none"">Aralast NP, Zemaira, Prolastin-C, and Glassia. Currently only symptomatic therapy is available to control the liver abnormalities. Research and studies are still in different stages for investigational drugs and therapy for A1AD.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This month AUHS spotlights our new Center for Academic Success Coordinator, Kristie Nguyen, MPH.&nbsp; Kristie was born in Vietnam and her family came to the US ten years ago. Their family is very involved in medicine and education; in fact, her mother has both an MD and an EdD.&nbsp; Her father is in education and her sister is a PA student. The odd one out is her brother who loves physics (maybe he will teach medical physics!). Kristie, besides her work in the Center for Academic Success has done medical research and published articles on malaria and nutrition.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

She volunteers or donates there every other week.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Her thoughts about the future are: “Life is short, and I wish to see every patient live longer and strive to their fullest potential while they still can. I aspire to join the healthcare leaders and professionals to directly and positively impact patients’ health.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Kristie not only impacts patients’ health through her volunteer work and research, but by contributing to the success of future healthcare workers through her coordination of the Center for Academic Success. Trinium shines the spotlight on our new Coordinator for Academic Success and welcomes her to AUHS.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">On March 18, 2022, the AUHS School of Nursing held its White Coat Ceremony for the students of the MSN programs: Nurse Practitioner, Nursing Administration, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (Post Master’s), and Nursing Education. The ceremony emphasizes the qualities of compassion and scientific excellence. It was a joyful occasion where the students had a chance to socialize and share their accomplishment with their families. The keynote speaker, Michael Omega, spoke about how they were able to help each other to meet the many challenges they faced. As the scriptures remind us, “two are better than one” (Eccl. 4: 9).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>By Brent Davis, PhD, MA, MA</strong><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This month we begin a new focus article </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">The Pillar of the Foundation</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> and our inaugural pillar is Maria Shearing.&nbsp; She is an amazing person: student</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">, </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">teacher, nurse, wife, and mother of nine. Oh, and she is an extremely involved volunteer for the AUHS Foundation!</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Her involvement with the foundation began when she attended the general information session prior to enrolling at AUHS. Pastor Johnson spoke about the mission of AUHS and how we could help. Then staff, leadership and faculty continued to elaborate on what it meant for students to get their</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">community service hours.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">“</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">I was looking forward to it, not quite sure what it would all entail. In the beginning I thought</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">, ‘</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">ok, I need to get this done,’” she continued. It was a check list kind of thing, but as soon as she started to complete her</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">hours,</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">she realized it was so much more than a list</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Her</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">work has consisted in helping the underserved</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Soon after her volunteer hours started,</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">she felt differently about serving the underserved, and began to see what a privilege it was. A volunteer event that still</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">, </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">to this day</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">,</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> warms her heart was “Lamp unto My Feet</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">.” </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">At this event she had the opportunity to wash the feet of the homeless; it was a very humbling experience. The blessing of this event was for the ones doing the washing because the people were beyond grateful, and </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">“</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">couldn’t believe we would do such an act.</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">” </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">She remembers how some cried</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. “</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">This act worked within my heart so much more than I could ever imagine.</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">” </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">She said that It was true what they say</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">:</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> so many times, we think what a blessing this and that is without realizing that sometimes it’s more of a blessing for the individual doing the act and</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">, “</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">we just never know how God is working within us. It’s HIS perfect timing always!</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As a volunteer, she has come to realize how important the role is. She has donated more than 500 community service hours to the AUHS foundation and their events to help the underserved and the community. As a child her parents did a lot for the underserved. A Bible verse her mom used to quote is “…do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,” </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">(</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Matthew 6:3 NIV). Her mother helped so many people out of the goodness of her heart ever since she was young, and Maria believes this is where it all started for her</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">She was able to experience her parents’ passion for helping the underserved firsthand</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Maria also supports the foundation by enjoying what the foundation stands for, Ms. Suss’ passion for getting the word out shows the volunteer</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">the amount of dedication needed to share with the rest of the world</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> —</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> to move hearts towards Jesus. Maria also looks forward to the many events that are to come and involving her family as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Speaking of her family, it consists of nine members</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">yes nine</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">)! </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">She</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">is married with seven children of whom five are now grown and out of the house. She and her husband continue to raise two happy and healthy teenage boys. Her husband is very supportive</span> <span data-contrast=""auto"">and without him none of this would have been possible. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">She is a proud alumna of the university and is now an MSN student</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Also, she is working for AUHS as a clinical instructor and a clinical site supervisor. She enjoys what she does here and feels blessed by the opportunities that have been given to her by Pastor Johnson, Ms. Kim, Dr. Uvero, and Dr. Ryan</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Being a volunteer for the foundation and Ms. Suss’ team has allowed her to experience God’s greatness on a different level. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">“</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">To be a part of this is what makes me desire to do so much more.</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">But wait there’s more! She also works as an emergency department (ED</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">)</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> nurse caring for the underserved community and take pride in educating the patients I serve and providing A1 quality care, just as Jesus does for her. Staying at patients’ bedsides will </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">“</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">keep me up to date in the skills we teach. </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">“</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">One wonders, are there any dreams left? Her dreams for the future are to continue to serve the underserved as well as to spark interest for her kids to do the same, to stay firm in her faith and for her family to follow in those steps, to share the same passion with our students, staff, coworkers, </span><b><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">and</span></i></b><span data-contrast=""auto""> to one day assume the top leadership position at AUHS</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">,</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> and to continue to serve the Foundation in any way possible. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Maria concludes by urging us to be pillars of the foundation</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">We should support the foundation because it provides a comprehensive high-volume outreach not only to the few but to the many as God would have it.  The foundation provides selfless service with an ever-increasing breadth of services that everyone should be proud of.  Of greatest note to her is serving the homeless and those at risk for homelessness, and the underserved.  </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Dr. Hussain has been part of AUHS since March 2020. According to his biography on the webpage for the School of Pharmacy:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Hussain received his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutics from the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Amarillo, TX, and his B.S. in Pharmacy from Kakatiya University in India. Prior to joining AUHS, Dr. Hussain worked as an Assistant Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the Universities of Louisiana and Oklahoma. He has taught both professional pharmacy and graduate students various courses including, but not limited to, Pharmaceutics, Compounding Pharmacy, Pharmacokinetics, Physical Pharmacy, Advanced Drug Delivery and Targeting, Pharmaceutical Technology, Medical Microbiology, and Biotechnology. He has also mentored several M.S. and Ph.D. students throughout his career.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""none"">Alamdar began his association with AUHS at a website advertising a faculty position in the School of Pharmacy and thought it would not be as cold and windy as the Great Plains where he lived at the time.

 Cyanoacrylate Adhesive Glue Exposures,https://news.auhs.edu/19118-2/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pexels-cottonbro-3997379-600x403.jpeg,Health Advice and Warnings,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Cyanoacrylate Adhesive Glue Exposures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">False fingernails and false eyelashes have gone from a special occasion look to becoming an everyday necessity for some.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Most of these adhesives are typically made of an adhesive component, solvents, surfactants, and ammonium hydroxide. Some adhesives contain glycol ethers, which are potentially toxic if swallowed. Glycol ethers are a group of solvents that are commonly found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, cleaners, and many other industrial and home products. The toxic dose of most glycol ethers is unknown. Many adhesives can contain chemicals that are generally irritating like alcohol and detergents.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Commonly a cyanoacrylate adhesive is used. Cyanoacrylate is also found in instant bond glues like Super Glue® or Krazy Glue®.&nbsp; In liquid form, cyanoacrylate exists as monomers. When they interact with water or the moisture in the air, the monomers polymerize and join to bond surfaces together. It is a fast-acting adhesive that dries and sets within seconds. Cyanoacrylate can be an irritant to the skin and eyes in liquid form and when its fumes are inhaled. Once cyanoacrylates are dried, they are inert. However, dried cyanoacrylate forms a small, solid lump that can be physically irritating to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Treatment for swallowing any cyanoacrylate adhesives includes rinsing out the mouth and drinking a few sips of water. Life-threatening airway obstruction can occur if a large amount of cyanoacrylate adhesive is swallowed or inhaled.

 Carbon Monoxide Exposure,https://news.auhs.edu/carbon-monoxide-exposure/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pexels-khunkorn-laowisit-5233284-600x403.jpeg,Health Advice and Warnings,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Carbon Monoxide Exposure&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>by Grant D. Lackey, PharmD, FCSHP&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous, colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Although it has no detectable odor, CO is often mixed with other gases that do&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">have an odor. So, you can inhale carbon monoxide right along with gases that you&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">can smell and not even know that CO is present.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Carbon monoxide poisoning is caused by inhaling combustion fumes. When too much carbon monoxide is in the air you’re breathing, your body replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells with carbon monoxide. This prevents oxygen from reaching your tissues and organs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Various fuel-burning appliances and engines produce carbon monoxide. The amount of carbon monoxide produced by these sources usually isn’t a cause for concern, but if they’re used in a closed or partially closed space — cooking with a charcoal grill indoors, for example — the carbon monoxide can build to dangerous levels and cause serious toxicity.&nbsp; The fumes from an internal combustion engine in an automobile are some of the most common sources of exposure. Smoke inhalation during a fire can also cause carbon monoxide poisoning.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

 Broken Thermometers – Poison? ,https://news.auhs.edu/broken-thermometers-poison/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pexels-maksim-goncharenok-5995230-600x403.jpeg,Health Advice and Warnings,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Broken Thermometers – Poison?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>by Grant D. Lackey, PharmD, FCSHP&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Exposure to broken thermometers can lead to injury from the broken glass or plastic. Studies of children in emergency rooms have noted injury to the mouth, rectum, and ear from broken thermometers. There can be other minor dangers related to thermometers depending on the type of liquid inside them.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The non-silver, liquid-in-glass thermometers typically contain a colored alcohol. Contact with the skin or inside the mouth could cause minor irritation or a burning sensation that should go away quickly with rinsing. Drinking a few swallows of water or milk to rinse the substance down and keeping the person in an upright position in the event of vomiting is all that is needed.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Some liquid-in-glass thermometers contain a non-mercury silver substance Galinstan®. Galinstan liquid consists of tin, indium, and gallium.&nbsp; Galinstan is not toxic when swallowed as it passes through the digestive system without effect. Inhalation is also not a concern because there is no absorption through the lungs. Skin exposures to Galinstan can cause mild irritation.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Although unlikely, if the liquid is silver in color, it might be mercury. Spilled mercury has a unique appearance.

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Social accountability is essential in shaping future healthcare education, research, and medical care in response to present and future societal needs. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined social accountability in medical education as “the obligation to direct their education, research and service of activities towards addressing the priority health concerns of the community, region and/or nation that they have a mandate to serve. The priority health concerns are to be identified jointly by governments, health care organizations, health professionals, and public.”&nbsp; In recent years, the issues of social justice and social accountability in healthcare education have come to the forefront.</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157221/#R3""><span data-contrast=""none"">3</span></a><span data-contrast=""none"">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""none""> T</span><span data-contrast=""none"">he onus has been on health education institutions to be responsive to societal needs.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. In the United States, it is estimated that about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancer, and about one in eight women (13%) will develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetime. Breast cancer is genetically and epigenetically not just one disease, but a diverse group of disorders with various clinical features. Most breast cancer (about 81%) is invasive cancer. It can be further classified into four subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like, depending on the presence of hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Basal-like breast cancer is commonly known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The term “triple-negative” in TNBC comes from its unique composition of lacking three receptors; the majority of TNBC patients lack expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) and overexpression or amplification of HER2. TNBC is a more aggressive type of breast tumor because it grows rapidly and is more likely to spread, resulting in a high metastatic potential. TNBC also has higher recurrence rates even after being treated with chemotherapy, which is the mainstay for TNBC treatment. These features means that TNBC represents over 50% of the mortality of breast cancer, whereas it accounts for 15–20% of all cases. In addition, health disparities have been highlighted in breast cancers, most probably due to TNBC. In detail, the aggressive TNBC subtype of breast cancer is identified more frequently in African-American women in advanced stages than Caucasian-American women, and African-American women exhibit the lowest survival rate of any race or ethnic group at the same cancer stage. Even with newly approved therapeutics, only a limited number of TNBC patients could benefit from the regimens. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been of great interest as a potential therapeutic target for cancers due to its impacts on tumor progression, metastasis, and clinical outcomes. In this paper, Dr. Yang et al. discuss the roles of PDI members in breast cancers such as TNBC and the PDI inhibitors studied in breast cancer research.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">PDIs play a critical role in ER proteostasis by assisting protein folding as an essential catalyst for disulfide bonds and as a chaperone. PDI members are upregulated alongside other UPR proteins in cancers, highlighting the importance of PDI in regulating cancer cell survival. Due to the protective role of PDIs in cancer cells, the prolonged inhibition of PDIs has emerged as a promising approach to induce excessive ER stress in cancer cells, leading to apoptosis in cancers. PDI proteins are mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but are also found on cell surfaces, in the nucleus, in the extracellular space, or in mitochondria. Although the exact functions of PDIs at different subcellular localizations are not yet fully demonstrated, it seems to be apparent that PDIs at different localizations have different functions in cancers. PDIs localized in the endoplasmic reticulum are involved in UPR pathways that determine cell survival or cell death through redox regulation of UPR stress receptors such as IRE1, PERK, or ATF6, and regulation of ERAD and autophagy. PDIs located at the cell surface are involved in cell adhesion and migration as evidenced in breast cancer or glioblastoma. Inhibition of extracellular PDIs could impair cell adhesion and migration by inhibiting the activation of metalloproteases and integrins. The roles of PDIs in mitochondria have been suggested to be regulating endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial calcium dynamics.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">In this review, several PDI members, including PDIA1 (P4HB), might be considered as interesting molecular targets for TNBC as evidenced by the overexpression in the TNBC subtype compared to other breast cancer subtypes and the superior inhibition effects on the adhesion and migration of TNBC cells. Their functions as transcription cofactors such as ERα, NF-kB, or Nrf2 are interesting because they seem to be involved in antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment and tumor immunorecognition.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There were a few studies exploring PDIs in breast cancers, but now an increased number of reports suggest the involvement of PDIs in tumorigenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and poor prognosis in breast cancer, including TNBC. However, there is no clear evidence of which specific PDIs are impacting each process nor of their exact mechanisms of action. To develop PDI inhibitors targeting specific breast cancer subtypes such as TNBC, continuous efforts are required to identify the exact roles and mechanisms of specific PDI isoforms involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and antigen presentation in TNBC.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Sildenafil, a drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may be useful in treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable, degenerative brain illness that causes major neurocognitive disorder by destroying memory and other essential mental functions. The connections between brain cells, as well as the cells themselves, deteriorate and die. The major symptoms are memory loss and confusion due to the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, a type of plaque in the brain that clumps together and inhibits cell function. In normal functioning neurons, a protein called tau attaches to and stabilizes microtubules. In Alzheimer’s patients, these tau proteins undergo chemical alterations, leading them to clump together. The tau proteins can detach and cluster together, producing tangles which disrupt neuronal function.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:10,&quot;335559739&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:256,&quot;335559991&quot;:10}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Although there is no cure, current drugs such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, may help to alleviate symptoms temporarily. These acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy, increasing levels of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine.&nbsp; Less than half of patients achieve improvements in cognition after taking these medications.&nbsp; Memantine is another FDA approved medication for use in moderate-to-severe AD.&nbsp; Memantine is an uncompetitive Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Also, having 24-hour caregivers, ensuring drug adherence, and providing continuous monitoring are all examples of management measures in caring for AD patients.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:10,&quot;335559739&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:256,&quot;335559991&quot;:10}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Sildenafil, a generic version of Viagra and Revatio, has shown some promise in treating neurons affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Early research published in the Nature Aging journal in December 2021 suggested that people who used sildenafil had a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The NIH’s mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. There are twenty-seven different institutes and centers (ICs) of which twenty-four offer funding opportunities and award grants. The institutes and the centers are the following: the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Eye Institute (NEI), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institute on Aging (NIA),National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS),National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute of Nursing Research&nbsp; (NINR),National Library of Medicine (NLM), Center for Information Technology (CIT), Center for Scientific Review (CSR), Fogarty International Center (FIC), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), and the NIH Clinical Center (CC). Funding is made available through NIH institutes and centers. Before applying for a grant, search an IC that may be suitable for your research and grant application to ensure that your proposal fits within the mission of the IC. A literature search should also prevent submitting a proposal where the work has already been conducted or the result of the driving hypothesis is already known to maximize your chance to secure a successfully funded NIH grant.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The rest is commentary and now go study.”&nbsp; Two great lines of thought and their followers developed from these rabbis:&nbsp; the School of Hillel and the School of Shammai (Bais Hillel and Bais Shammai).&nbsp; Saul, before his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus (who later became Paul), was a follower of Shammai.&nbsp; Saul persecuted the followers of Jesus as heretics.&nbsp; As a rabbi in the tradition of Hillel, Jesus was viewed as a heretic by the Pharisees, Saul, and other followers of Shammai.&nbsp; Besides his rabbinic teachings, the other reason that the Pharisees could not accept Jesus as the mashiach or messiah was that he did not overthrow the Roman Empire.&nbsp; This prophesy was consummated under Constantine and codified at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, when the Roman Empire formally converted to Christianity.&nbsp; The name Jesus comes from Greek writers [via French, </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">ed.</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">], since there is no ‘J’ in Hebrew.&nbsp; Jesus was born with the Hebrew name of Yeshua (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">יְהוֹשֻׁעַ</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">).&nbsp; In Hebrew he would be called Yeshua Hamashiach (the Messiah).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>By Ann Chung, PharmD&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Laguna Hills Health and Rehabilitation Center (LHHRC) has been established for a couple of years for our IPPE students as an institutional health rotation. As new precepting faculty taking over the site, we reached out to former preceptors to discuss ideas and which robust, educational/experiential programs we could continue, improve, and develop as we transitioned.&nbsp; We also met with the LHHRC director to express our continued interest to be at the site for students to complete their Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE) education. As preceptors on site, we have agreed to support and provide the facility with any immediate pharmaceutical or drug information resources within the realm and legality of our practice. In addition, we will continue to provide medication reconciliation for new admissions to and discharges from the facility.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">For the students, we provide the syllabus, schedule, and expectation for the site; we prepare a daily and weekly schedule for the entire rotation. Further, we list topics of discussion for each day and provide reading material and homework questions for each topic.&nbsp; Each student also has a final project and presentation at the end of the rotation. The project ranges from a mini research, case presentation, journal club presentation, disease state presentation, or new drug in-service. S</span><span data-contrast=""none"">tudents are expected to be involved with the facility in-service relating to medication as requested by the facility. In January students assisted the facility with administering COVID vaccine or boosters to the employees on site.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">This site is a unique site because students will experience a lot of interaction with the geriatric population and young patients with long-term disabilities due to inherited or catastrophic health disease/conditions. Students will have the opportunity to learn more in depth about Beers criteria, anticholinergic drugs, diseases, and conditions that commonly affect the elderly population (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, falls, depression, chronic medical condition, diabetes type 2, hypercholesterolemia, stroke, etc.).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Students are exposed to an electronic health record system (EHR) and how to assess patient cases using a hybrid chart. They learn the importance of LHHRC and how it fits in the entire healthcare system.&nbsp; They learn about the law (Title 22) that regulates long-term care. They learn about the policies, procedures, and protocols of the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Finally, students are expected to perform medication reconciliation, apply their didactic knowledge, evaluate complex drug regimens, identify med errors, meet with the patient prior to discharge, develop skills on how to interview patients, identify any drug knowledge gaps and provide accurate drug information. Students shadow a medication administration nurse to observe and learn the process.&nbsp; Students meet with a wound care nurse and observe the treatment procedure.&nbsp; They also meet with other health care team members of the facility such as dietitians, social workers, and the facility administrator. Through these activities, we hope to promote inter-disciplinary awareness and to enable our future pharmacists to be effective members of a healthcare team.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Sister Marie Therese started the Lestonnac Free Clinic as a small Catholic clinic in 1979.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Ed Gerber, its current executive director, Lestonnac has broadened its reach of care for the underserved to 14 active satellite clinics across Southern California.&nbsp; There are still over ten more satellite clinics in the planning phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Lestonnac provides Southern California’s uninsured and underserved residents with comprehensive medical care and over 20 specialty care services, including dental and vision services.&nbsp; The clinic also is a part of the Community Referral Network (CRN), a web-based referral platform that facilitates relationships between community clinics and hospitals to bridge service gaps for underserved patients.&nbsp; During the pandemic, the clinic has also been operating a mobile clinic, providing telemedicine, pharmacy, and nursing services to outlying communities.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Lestonnac Free Clinic’s mission is to provide free healthcare services to low-income and uninsured residents in Southern California through the support of generous volunteers and donors.&nbsp; American University of</span> <span data-contrast=""none"">Health Sciences’ mission is to prepare future healthcare professionals “</span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">to make a positive impact on society through the provision of exceptional quality patient-centered care within the context of a global perspective of the human condition</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">These two missions met at a critical crossroads during the recent ongoing pandemic when AUHS’s Pharmacy students started training at APPE rotations within several Lestonnac Free Clinic locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">AUHS is one of the primary supporters of the Lestonnac Free Clinic and its mission to offer healthcare to the needy, hoping that healthcare will be accessible to those who cannot afford insurance.&nbsp; Dr. Elaine Nguyen started this partnership program with the help of Dr. Young Il Chang; Dr. Chang has been the key preceptor for AUHS at Lestonnac since the program’s inception.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Since the beginning of the pandemic, AUHS’s pharmacy students have been training under the tutelage of AUHS faculty in Orange and Norwalk, two of Lestonnac’s main locations for serving patients.&nbsp; The two missions of LFC and AUHS have merged into a single purpose for AUHS students and future clinicians, to serve the underserved patient demographic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Lestonnac Free Clinic’s (LFC) unique organization model is supported by three core values: Leadership, Functionality, and Creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp; AUHS prepares students through the five pillars (CARDS) of Christian Values, Academic Preparation, Research and Scholarship, Diversity, Service (or Social Responsibility).&nbsp; These two sets of core values and character pillars are fundamental in the training of future healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Lestonnac provides the ideal environment for AUHS’s pharmacy students to train and study alongside medical providers, and nursing, pharmacy, and medical students from other universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">AUHS students recognize our role as healthcare providers in community development and social health service through Christian values.&nbsp; Lestonnac, as a Catholic-based, non-profit clinic, provides the preparatory stages for the students to learn and serve the community.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">The old saying that ‘</span><b><i><span data-contrast=""none"">nothing happens in God’s world by mistake</span></i></b><span data-contrast=""none"">‘ holds true.&nbsp; AUHS and Lestonnac’s missions cultivate these students and future healthcare professionals at the crossroads of the pandemic; nurture their empathy and compassion, train them professionally and scholarly.&nbsp; Most importantly, this partnership gives the students a “</span><i><span data-contrast=""none"">taste of the noble privilege of community service</span></i><span data-contrast=""none"">” and works toward improving healthcare for everyone in our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">For each academic year, there are several (e.g., 3) onsite IPE Simulation Days held at Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital. Each Simulation Day consists of students progressing through 4 clinical scenarios (e.g., preeclampsia with hypertensive emergency, seizure, organophosphate poisoning, or cardiac arrest).&nbsp; Simulations are staged in nursing units or emergency overflow rooms with mid-fidelity mannequins, actors, and medical equipment / pharmaceutical props. All simulation scenarios are video recorded and student performances evaluated onsite by physician, nursing, and pharmacy faculty as well as the simulation actors. After the simulations, students and faculty debrief on the experience and share feedback and self-reflections.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Among the several genetic variants of the SARS-Co-2 virus that causes COVID-19, the alpha and delta mutations seemed to cause the most severe forms of the disease, while the most recent, omicron variant (discovered in South Africa at the end of November 2021) appears to be the most rapidly spreading and infectious agent during this almost 3-year pandemic. One of the reasons for the relatively good news about omicron is the accumulating clinical observation that this virus mutation affects only the upper respiratory tract and not the lungs, which was the main initial target of the delta variant. Hence, people infected with omicron have only mild, flu (common cold)-like symptoms &amp; signs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">A recent summary in </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Nature Briefing</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto""> on “Omicron’s feeble attack on the lungs could make it less dangerous” demonstrated the scientific basis for this, e.g., omicron ‘struggles’ to attach to ACE-2 receptors in the lung, but cannot, at least in most cases.&nbsp; This article also states: “Authorities in South Africa announced on 30 December that the country had passed its omicron peak without a major spike in deaths. And a 31 December UK government report said that people in England who were infected with omicron were about half as likely to require hospitalization or emergency care as those infected with delta.” </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">1</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This conclusion actually supports the initial impression that “Omicron Variant Might Help Defend Against Delta, Lab Study Suggests.” </span><span data-contrast=""auto"">2</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> Furthermore, we now know that vaccinated people who get infected with omicron get a very high level, so called “hybrid” or “super” immunity.&nbsp; This, in good part, is based on the fact (described below in a recent issue of </span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">Nature Briefing</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">) that the additional omicron infection elevates not only our soluble antibodies (produced by our B lymphocytes and plasma cells) but also activates our T cells, i.e., our killer lymphocytes that kill &amp; eliminate infected cells of our body! This is a major discovery and further good news in our struggles during COVID-19 pandemic and:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Killer T immune cells still recognize Omicron variant: Evidence is building that specialized immune cells called T cells can recognize variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including omicron, even when antibodies can’t. In people who have been infected or vaccinated, neutralizing antibodies bind to a handful of regions on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. When those sites mutate, antibodies can’t recognize the virus, and protection fades. T cells, however, are more resilient. By killing infected cells, T cells can limit the spread of infection — and potentially reduce the chance of serious illness. The findings raise the question of whether researchers assessing the potential efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines should look at T-cell responses, and not just the levels of antibodies they trigger.</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">3</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Most epidemics, as with the 100-year-old ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic and the more recent SARS &amp; MERS epidemics, viruses get attenuated, becoming weak, but still able to create a ‘herd immunity.’ The most pessimistic predictions in the public health community are that eventually, soon-or-later, all or most of us will get mild COVID-19, but we shall survive.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">It has now been two years since the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as COVID-19, was identified. It was originally seen as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China but quickly spread worldwide (USDHHS, 2021). Since it was first discovered there have been 331 million cases, resulting in 5.55 million deaths (Allen et al, 2022). Mass vaccination efforts have lessened the likelihood of severe illness and the need for hospitalization or death related to the virus, but even those who are fully vaccinated appear to be able to contract and spread the virus (CDC, 2021). The virus continues to mutate, producing new variants with different characteristics. The newest variant of interest, omicron, is spread more easily than the original virus (CDC, 2021).&nbsp; Easier spread, coupled with holiday gatherings and “Coronavirus burnout” or “pandemic fatigue” (Parrish, 2020), has most likely contributed to the surge in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. Preliminary data on omicron, which is estimated to be the cause of up to 95% of COVID-19 cases in the United States (CDC, 2022), suggests that in most cases the infection may be less severe, but the public is urged not to take infection with omicron COVID-19 lightly. It can still cause severe disease and “long COVID.” [more on this in Dr. Szabo’s article] as well as putting a strain on the workforce (particularly the healthcare workforce), the supply chain, and local, national, and global economies. The best preventive measures remain vaccination (with a booster recommended for adults 18 and over who received their first vaccination series at least 6 months ago), high quality medical-grade masks, social distancing, and testing before gathering with those outside your household (CDC, 2021).</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

The new omicron variant of the virus is responsible (at the time of writing this abstract, mid-December 2021) for 73% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. As bad as the COVID-19 pandemic has been with its socioeconomic devastation around the world, its mortality of 1-2% is relatively low.&nbsp; Nevertheless, COVID-19 is almost unique among infectious diseases in that, when cured, patients do not have long term sequelae or rapid recurrence. About 30% of COVID-19 patients, on the other hand, will come back within 4-8 weeks with a variety of ailments not just related to the lungs: e.g., fatigue, headache, ‘brain fog’ and other brain or peripheral neurologic complaints. This new syndrome is now called ‘long COVID-19’ and represents the </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">focus </span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">of our multidisciplinary investigation. The cause and mechanisms of ‘long COVID-19” are poorly understood, but since we know that the incidence of ‘long COVID-19’ varies around the world from 20-40%, we designed our approach to involve countries from Africa (Ghana, South Africa) and Asia (Bangladesh, Vietnam) with which to compare four countries in Europe: the least developed Ukraine, Greece and Hungary in the middle, and the most sophisticated Germany.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">We stress that our </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">international collaborative team</span></b><span data-contrast=""none""> is not a rapidly put together coalition. Rather, they have been included on the basis of previous teacher-student connections, being former classmates, and collaboration on other scientific, public health-related projects. Furthermore, since 4 members of our ‘home team’ are graduates of the Harvard School of Public Health, we will also rely on the leadership of and consultation with the current faculty and dean (whom we know personally) of our ‘alma mater.’ Since the scientific literature indicates that nutritional deficiencies may be at least partially responsible for the regional variations and ‘unpredictability’ of ‘long COVID-19.’ These deficiencies include, for example, zinc which regulates immune functions; selenium, a potent antioxidant; and, niacin and thiamin, with their potent neurophysiologic effects. Our </span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">specific aims</span></b><span data-contrast=""none""> are focused on:&nbsp; (1) establishing the prevalence, incidence, and organ distribution of ‘long-COVID-19’ in the targeted countries; (2) measuring nutritional deficiencies which may be associated with complications of the post-COVID-syndrome; (3) detecting endocrine/hormonal changes, especially adrenocortical and gonadal insufficiency of the ‘post-COVID-19 stress syndrome’; (4) providing technical assistance to scale up public health readiness and economic consultation to improve the management of ‘long COVID-19’; and, (5) identifying potential targets for intervention/prevention and future investigations.

 The Omicron Variant and Its Impact on Nursing Students and Health Care Workers,https://news.auhs.edu/the-omicron-variant-and-its-impact-on-nursing-students-and-health-care-workers/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-gustavo-fring-3985163-600x403.jpg,Articles,"<p style=""text-align: center""><strong>The Omicron Variant and Its Impact on Nursing Students and Health Care Workers</strong><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:2,&quot;335551620&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center""><span data-contrast=""auto"">By Maria Shearing, BSN, RN, PHN</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Throughout the era of the coronavirus pandemic, variants have continued to emerge, as the SARS-COV-2 continues to mutate and evolve. In November 2021, a new variant of the coronavirus emerged. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the variant omicron, which was later termed as “a variant of concern (VOC)” (He et al., 2021). According to Goga et al. (2021), omicron significantly infects a larger number of healthcare workers (HCW) aged between 18 and 30 years, compared to those aged 55 years and above. As a student nurse taking the MSN degree, one should adhere to the measures undertaken by the institution to mitigate the risk of the omicron variant.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">However, the CDC (2021) has created uncertainty by shortening the time that individuals should be isolated from the public, as those who have been tested positive for COVID-19 should now keep away from the public for 5 days. Also, those who are asymptomatic or with resolving symptoms should continue wearing masks for another 5 days when in public to minimize the risks of infecting other people with the variant. The directives have been motivated by the scientific discovery that most SARS-COV-2 transmission happens in the early stages of the illness, that is, around 1-2 days before the symptoms emerge, and 2-3 days after the emergence of symptoms.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The directives by the CDC will benefit students who have tested positive for omicron, as well those who want to do practicum experience as HCWs in various hospitals and clinics. Both students and staff members of the American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) have been encouraged to go for testing within the institution, as a way of keeping the omicron variant outside the institution. AUHS offers the BSN, MSN and PharmD degrees and is located in Signal Hill, California. The BSN and MSN degrees are fully accredited by the CCNE and the PharmD is in candidate status. The MSN provides concentrations in nurse practitioner, administrator and educator.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto""> Planning for taking the COVID test, choosing a testing site at a convenient place, and making the process fast, can encourage people to take the test (Anthes, 2021). Our institution’s leadership has scheduled and offered free testing onsite to encourage students to be tested for the variant to follow the guidelines imposed by the CDC and, most importantly, to keep everyone safe.&nbsp; Those who are found positive, both students and staff, should follow the guidelines, isolate, and retest after the 5</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">th</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> day, as well as wear an appropriate and well-fitting mask and then return to campus when asymptomatic.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">There is a lot that the world has yet to learn about omicron, but students should protect themselves from the variant by wearing high-quality masks, including those rated FFP2 and FFP3, as they are considered more protective compared to cloth masks. Several vaccines, which include Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, including boosters, have been approved by WHO to mitigate the risk of contracting the variant (Shekhar et al., 2021). In addition, hand-washing and social distancing are other responsibilities for preventing the variant.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Methanol has a long history of severe toxicity and led to the term </span><b><span data-contrast=""auto"">“blind drunk”</span></b><span data-contrast=""auto""> because of its potential to damage the optic nerve. There have been historical outbreaks of poisoning from ingesting methanol both accidentally, intentionally, as an alcohol substitute, and from the topical administration of substances containing methanol.

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">This month we are excited to spotlight one of our alumni (Pharm. Tech. 1998), Thi Dang, PharmD.&nbsp; Dr. Dang describes herself as an independent pharmacy owner who is passionate about patient care, pharmacy, and entrepreneurship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Her connection with AUHS started when she met with Mrs. Kim and Pastor Gregory to start in the Pharmacy Tech program.&nbsp; She had just immigrated to the US as a late teen and was looking for a vision for her future.&nbsp; She had always admired pharmacy as profession because it helped people and was long-term, financially stable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kim and Pastor Gregory’s guidance, encouragement, and friendship was pivotal towards achieving this professional goal.&nbsp; Upon finishing the program, AUHS assisted her with a work placement at Long Beach Memorial Hospital.&nbsp; From there, she got her PharmD degree at the University of Colorado.&nbsp; Upon completing residency in pharmacy practice at UF Health, Jacksonville, she was hired as a clinical informatics pharmacist with the County of Los Angeles.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

When the opportunity came to give back, she was happy to support the AUHS Foundation which assists so many students to carve out their own path and to contribute back to the community with their wellness efforts, food drives, clothing drives, and health information programs.&nbsp; During the recent pandemic, Lieu Dang Suss and the Foundation coordinated with her pharmacy to provide vaccinations to the community.&nbsp; It was rewarding to her to help those who may not have been aware of this service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

With AUHS’s accelerated programs you could become a PharmD in 6 years and 3 months right out of high school (less if you have transferable college credits) while working as a Pharmacy Technician.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Last Friday (Nov. 26, 2021), the founding dean of the AUHS-SOM was an invited speaker at the 52nd Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for Wound Healing, with a presentation on “Principles of Wound Healing, with Special Reference to GI Ulceration.” &nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Because of COVID-19, this year’s conference was held via Zoom. Since gastrointestinal ulcers (GI) are essentially internal wounds, Dr. Szabo was invited due to his international reputation as a well-established investigator of GI ulceration. In his 50-minute-long lecture, he reviewed the main cellular and molecular mechanisms of wound healing and then focused on his more than 30 years of experience with GI ulcer research. Specifically, his laboratory was the first to describe the potent ulcer-healing effects of angiogenic growth factors, like basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in animal models of gastric and duodenal ulcers, as well as ulcerative colitis. The conference was attended by some 200 experts, mostly from Japan.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span data-contrast=""none"">Overall, I learned a tremendous amount from shadowing&nbsp;[the surveyor]&nbsp;for an entire day shift. It was a hectic and overwhelming shift and there was not one second, other than lunch, where I was not doing something incredibly important. I learned that as a hospital it is extremely important to have a baseline for competencies at all times throughout the year for all employees so that if surveyors do come at any random moment the hospital will be prepared.</span></i><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:864,&quot;335559737&quot;:864,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast=""none"">More and more children are being injured, or even dying, from swallowing buttons or disk batteries.</span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">&nbsp;A tragedy can easily be prevented. Batteries stuck in the esophagus must be removed as quickly as possible as serious damage can occur in just 2 hours. Batteries in the nose or ear also must be removed immediately to avoid permanent damage.&nbsp;Batteries are&nbsp;a source of power for&nbsp;all&nbsp;our&nbsp;electronic gadgets. Secure&nbsp;the battery compartment on remote controls, key fobs, cameras, watches, flameless candles, and every battery-powered product. If these larger lithium batteries are swallowed, they are more likely than smaller batteries to get stuck in a child’s esophagus, on the way down to the stomach. This can cause a burn right where the battery stops. The child may develop severe bleeding, leading to death; tissue injury that requires tube feeding; paralyzed vocal cords; and many other problems that require surgery and long recovery times.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Children&nbsp;</span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">MUST</span></b><span data-contrast=""none"">&nbsp;be prevented from reaching or handling button batteries. Button batteries, used for any purpose, from toys to hearing aids, MUST be used, and stored in a way that prevents children from handling them: lock new batteries away, store used batteries safely, tape up battery compartments that are not child-resistant, and track down any missing batteries immediately.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""none"">Prompt action is critical. Don’t wait for symptoms to develop. If the battery was swallowed, don’t eat or drink until an x-ray shows the battery is beyond the esophagus.&nbsp;</span><b><span data-contrast=""none"">If a&nbsp;battery is&nbsp;swallowed or&nbsp;placed in the&nbsp;ear or&nbsp;nose, immediately call the National Battery Ingestion Hotline at 800-498-8666.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Since the advent of penicillin in 1928, the world has been able to treat infections that were previously life threatening. From&nbsp;that time,&nbsp;multiple new classes of antibiotics have been&nbsp;developed and&nbsp;called in to use for a myriad of purposes, including treatment of disease in human and animals,&nbsp;as well as prophylactic use in animal feed.&nbsp; Due to over-use and&nbsp;inappropriate use,&nbsp;antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has&nbsp;developed. In the United&nbsp;States;&nbsp;it is estimated that 50% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary and inappropriate (Eudaley&nbsp;et al, 2018).&nbsp;AMR&nbsp;accounts for about 2 million infections per year, contributes to 23,000 deaths,&nbsp;and may cost up to an additional $2.2 billion annually in health care expenditures&nbsp;in the United States&nbsp;(Sanchez, Fleming-Dutra, Roberts &amp; Hicks, 2019).&nbsp;The statistics are even more alarming in lower-income countries,&nbsp;where AMR&nbsp;rates are currently higher and projected to increase at a higher rate than more developed, wealthier countries. In Brazil,&nbsp;India,&nbsp;and the Russian Federation, 40-60% of bacterial infections of record are attributable to antimicrobial-resistant&nbsp;pathogens, in comparison to the 17% credited to AMR in the wealthier&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">Organisation&nbsp;for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)&nbsp;countries such&nbsp;as the United States, Israel and Japan&nbsp;(OECD, 2018).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:115,&quot;335559731&quot;:605,&quot;335559738&quot;:32,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Increased globalization and mobility&nbsp;have&nbsp;led&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;rapid spread of these resistant infections, such as the spread of carbapenem-resistant&nbsp;</span><i><span data-contrast=""auto"">K. pneumonia&nbsp;</span></i><span data-contrast=""auto"">which has spread&nbsp;to countries in 3 continents within 5 years (OECD, 2018). This rate of spread is predicted to quicken. The development of new antimicrobials has slowed, due to&nbsp;decreased monetary investment in new research and&nbsp;the&nbsp;subsequent&nbsp;failure of experimental drugs to come to market (OECD, 2018).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:115,&quot;335559731&quot;:605,&quot;335559738&quot;:32,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Antibiotic stewardship has become increasingly important&nbsp;to attempt to combat&nbsp;AMR. For prescribers this means judicious use of antibiotics, providing&nbsp;antimicrobials based on symptoms and diagnosis rather than meeting patient expectations, tailoring prescribed antimicrobials based on community patterns of resistance, and, perhaps&nbsp;most importantly, educating patients&nbsp;on the proper way to take antibiotics:&nbsp;when they are required and not, and the dangers of AMR (White, 2019).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559738&quot;:32,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:480}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

How do we help people to dream – to make their dreams reality? The other day, I had a Funko notion. How do we remind people that their dreams can become reality? The other day I asked God how. How do we encourage people, to imagine and see their imagination take shape? The other day, I had a Funko moment and then found myself in line to get my Funko.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day at San Diego Comic-Con, I met a man who was kind. The other day, I had a Funko, multiverse experience, and found Brain Mariotti signing and taking a photo with me, my son and so, so, many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day, I thanked God for creating Brian and making these jumbo, Funko, singularities. The other day, I thanked God for blessing him, and his family and for allowing him to see his dream materialize. The other day I praised God for using Brian to provide dreamers tangible ways to take their fandom offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other day, God allowed Funko’s Brian Mariotti, Chief Executive Officer, to have another glorious day</p>

 Short History of a Long-Running Scientific Symposia Series,https://news.auhs.edu/short-history-of-a-long-running-scientific-symposia-series/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-negative-space-48604-600x403.jpg,Articles,"<p>Dissemination of research results between scientists usually happens via publications of original papers and review articles published in strictly controlled, peer-reviewed scientific journals. This is certainly a beneficial and useful way of communication, but it does not cover all the needs for scientific interaction. Namely, researchers often publish contradictory results, or they don’t agree on the interpretation of certain data, e.g., disputes arise and often proliferate if not well controlled or managed. A creative solution for this kind of problem is presented in this brief history.</p>
<p>In 1979 a stunning new discovery was published in one of the best-controlled and most respected scientific journals in the field of gastroenterology, i.e., in Gastroenterology (1). Namely, <em>Andre Robert</em>, MD, PhD (whom I knew personally, since he also got his PhD before me at the Institute of Hans Selye of the University of Montreal) described the prevention of chemically or drug-induced acute gastric erosions (or superficial bleeding ulcers) in rats pretreated with very low doses of prostaglandins (PG) that <strong><u>did not</u></strong> inhibit gastric acid secretion (1). Since this was not a typical ulcer treatment or prevention, he called the new phenomenon “gastric cytoprotection” in the accompanying editorial in Gastroenterology (2). This, almost unbelievable observation, created an uproar in the basic research and clinical gastrointestinal (GI) community. But very soon, not only new original publications appeared confirming the surprising results of Andre Robert (who worked at the Upjohn Pharmaceutical Company), but pretreatments of rats with very low doses (that didn’t inhibit acid secretion), of other anti-ulcer drugs (e.g., cimetidine &amp; probanthine) also inhibited the development of hemorrhagic gastric erosions induced by 100% ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH), very concentrated acid (HCl) or base (NaOH), or hot water.</p>
<p>Reading about these surprising results and coming from the institute of the ‘father of stress’ (at that time my research laboratory was in Boston at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School),&nbsp; I thought if so many drugs with very different structures and mechanisms of action exert this “gastric cytoprotection” – there must be some nonspecific background mechanism exerting its protection in the stomach, e.g., they may mobilize the&nbsp; antioxidant defense mechanisms of the stomach. Indeed, I was able to prove and publish in one of the best scientific journals in the world (Science) not only that pretreatment of rats with -SH containing chemicals like cysteine, N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst), methionine prevents the chemically induced gastric lesions, but pretreatment of experimental animals with -SH alkylators (e.g., iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide) abolished the protective effects of PG and other drugs (3). This led to intensive disputes (often in front of conference audiences) with my old friend and colleague Andre Robert who argued about the supremacy of PG (e.g., that they protect by stimulating gastric mucus secretion, etc.).</p>
<p>These discussions coincided with another dispute between two cell injury scientists who argued about the importance of intracellular calcium (<em>Sten Orrenius</em> at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who later became chair of the Nobel Prize Committee) vs. the critical role of phospholipases in cell damage (<em>John Farber</em> at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, – who later became a co-author of one of the most modern &amp; popular textbooks of pathology). Since I knew all these players personally, I proposed to them to have a few dedicated symposia where we could compare results and discuss their meaning in a friendly, professional atmosphere; I also reminded my friends about the Greek origin of the word “symposium” (meaning ‘eating &amp; drinking party’). At the time another famous clinical investigator, <em>Klaus Henning Usadel</em> (professor of medicine at the University of Frankfurt in Germany) made another surprising discovery about the hepatoprotective, and subsequently the gastroprotective effects of the ‘paninhibitor’ somatostatin. Hence, we also invited him to join our group and the five of us (i.e., <em>Robert, Szabo, Farber, Orrenius, Usadel</em>) became the founders of what we called “International Symposia on Cell/Tissue Injury &amp; Cytoprotection/Organoprotection” (ISCTICO).&nbsp; &nbsp;The first meeting was organized in 1986 by Prof. Usadel in Heidelberg, Germany; the second one by me in 1989 at Harvard Medical School. After moving to UCI, I organized two more events with the assistance of famous UCI gastroenterologist Prof. <em>Andy Tarnawski</em> (who replaced Andre Robert, after his untimely early death, in the ISCTICO) in Long Beach, CA. Subsequently, symposia were organized in many countries of the world; many of these were attended by several Nobel Laureates as invited speakers. The most recent conference, the 11<sup>th</sup> ISCTICO was in Pecs, Hungary in October, where I was invited to give two overview presentations: one as a co-founder about the origins of these conferences and one on the important role of early vascular injury in gastric mucosal injury and COVID-19 (4, 5).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The take-home-message for young investigators is that, if you are challenged or your results do not agree with others, do not argue, invite other colleagues to try to find a neutral ground, e.g., at special sessions at international conferences &amp; congresses. Anybody interested in the longer history of ISTICO, please look at my book chapter on this topic, published a few years ago (6). &nbsp;The bottom line is: make friends, not enemies!</p>

For example, “scholarly teaching” and other teaching related activities have been described as SoTL (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">5</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">,</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">6),</span><span data-contrast=""auto""> but they remain two discrete constructs. Scholarly teaching is grounded in critical reflection, while SoTL is a systematic or methodological inquiry to obtain credible results which are peer-reviewed, critiqued, and shared with broader community (</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">4).</span><span data-contrast=""auto"">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Dr. Islam’s study involved a survey of faculty awareness of and attitudes towards SoTL and its role in the faculty promotion and tenure process in US colleges/schools of pharmacy. A total of 643 faculty members from 139 colleges/schools of pharmacy responded to the survey. The responses on what constitutes SoTL from a notable majority of pharmacy faculty framed SoTL as the study of a broad spectrum of academic practices that include teaching and learning activities such as course-level instructions and assessment, current teaching and learning principles and practices, the curriculum development process which lead to peer-reviewed dissemination. The study made a clear distinction between SoTL and “scholarly teaching.” In addition, they further broadened the scope of SoTL practices. For example, designing a new course, experiential education, interprofessional education, student leadership, co-curricular activities, faculty development, integration of technology in the classroom, were also considered as common areas of SoTL by pharmacy faculty provided the works resulted in peer-reviewed publication.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The results of this study show that most of the responding pharmacy faculty recognize and value SoTL and support the incorporation of SoTL research into the promotion and tenure processes in pharmacy academia. Future studies involving qualitative analysis of promotion and tenure documents of colleges and school of pharmacy will likely provide valuable information on the status of SoTL in faculty promotion and tenure. In addition, future works are also warranted on how the pharmacy schools or colleges embrace initiatives surrounding SoTL such as faculty development, cross-institutional collaboration, institutional funding, and inclusion of SoTL in strategic initiatives and promotion, and tenure criteria.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

 Using Simulation During the COVID Pandemic,https://news.auhs.edu/using-simulation-during-the-covid-pandemic/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Simulation-Lab-6-600x403.jpg,Articles,"<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The recent COVID-19 Pandemic has caused schools of all kinds to modify how they deliver education. One of the elements that AUHS has embraced is a deeper integration of simulation in the Nursing and Pharmacy programs. This decision was made due to the evidenced-based best practices that have been documented in research. In particular, a 2014 study asked the question “Can simulation deliver the same education that standard clinical experience gives students?” (Hayden, Smiley, Alexander, Kardong-Edgren, &amp; Jeffries, 2014).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This five-year study tracked groups of nursing students that had varying levels of simulation in their clinical education, some of which had 100% simulation with no clinical sessions. The results were staggering: Not only did all the groups that were doing simulation perform similarly as the traditional clinical sessions, but the higher the amount of simulation, the better the long-term results (Hayden, Smiley, Alexander, Kardong-Edgren, &amp; Jeffries, 2014)! This clearly indicates the power of simulation to provide education that equals or exceeds traditional clinical sessions.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Nursing schools are regulated by Boards of Nursing in the states they reside in, and the California Board of Nursing has been using the above-mentioned study as a basis for additional research in the use of simulation in Nursing programs. During the COVID pandemic, the California BRN increased the amount of simulation that can be used in Nursing programs as a way of dealing with reduced clinical availability, but also based on the results of this study. Here at AUHS we seek to implement evidence-based best practices in all we do, and we are pleased to see that our simulation program is growing. Our goal is to positively impact ALL our students.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">AUHS has been expanding the simulation program by building a new laboratory that will allow for robust sessions including audio and video recording. There are cameras and microphones spread throughout the lab, including in the patient care areas where high-fidelity manikins are in realistic hospital settings. These manikins include SimMan 3G which is a high-fidelity adult that can breathe, blink, sweat, urinate, bleed, and detect medications administered. SimMom is a labor and delivery manikin that can give birth to a baby and simulate pregnancy complications. SimJunior is a pediatric manikin that simulates a 5-year-old boy and can have seizures. We use this “family” of manikins to represent patients of all age groups, allow our students to apply their knowledge across the lifespan, and provide learning opportunities for ALL programs here at AUHS.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Please keep an eye out for more simulation content on AUHS social media accounts, as we explore learning at AUHS, and how to use evidence-based practices to enhance learning.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

 School of Nursing Update,https://news.auhs.edu/school-of-nursing-update/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Simulation-Lab-6-600x403.jpg,University News,"<p>Our students are doing more and more hands-on in the Skills Lab and in Simulation. Students are participating in weekly simulation in the Simulation Lab. They are engaged in clinical setting through a case scenario providing patient care, putting their theory into action. In this week’s simulation, students worked with 3-year-old clients with CP following a case scenario. Students interviewed the clients and family &nbsp; &nbsp;upon admission and followed physician orders. Each student had a specific role in the case scenario. The roles were charge nurse, staff nurse, patient, family member, and other specific team players seen in this clinical setting. We included a child life specialist in the pediatric scenario who was able to coach the child during IV insertion, preoperative procedure, foley catheter insertion, and post-operative care.</p>
<p>Students begin with interviewing the client, reviewing patient history, filling out the history and physical form, completing a head-to-toe assessment, following physician orders, fill out the flow sheet forms to match the case scenario. The forms are intake and output flow sheet, medication administration (MAR), physician orders, and nursing narrative notes.</p>
<p>They are placing IV per MD orders, placing foley catheters, preparing the patient for surgery, administering medication per MD order, and gathering pertinent information for patient care and concerns.</p>
<p>The students are providing patient care in the scenario and begin to plan for discharge home.</p>
<p>Post scenario students have a debriefing period where they can critique the scenario of what went well and what went wrong.</p>
<p>Students participating in a variety of roles, engaging in patient care, following out physician orders will help improve their skills in a very busy clinical setting.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Dr Arjun Dutta</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SB 493- Implications for the Profession of Pharmacy</strong></p>
<p>California has always been a bellwether state when it comes to the practice of pharmacy. The Pharm.D. degree has its roots in California and was first awarded in California in the 1950s. The Golden State took the lead yet again, to advance the practice of pharmacy, with the passage of SB-493.<br>
So, what is Senate Bill 493 and what does it mean for a pharmacist? The California Senate Bill No. 493 was signed into state law on October 1, 2013 and it added various components to the professional designation and job functions of a practicing pharmacist. Heretofore, pharmacists were not considered as healthcare providers and their job function and reimbursement was relegated mostly to the administration, orally or topically, of drugs and biologicals pursuant to a prescriber’s order. Furthermore, pharmacists could administer immunizations pursuant to a protocol with a prescriber and furnish emergency contraception drug therapy pursuant to standardized procedures if they had completed a training program.<br>
Senate Bill 493 vastly added to the pharmacists’ repertoire of services commensurate with their training and degree. The following is a summary of the bill and its provisions:<br>
This bill, instead, would authorize a pharmacist to administer drugs and biological products that have been ordered by a prescriber. The bill would authorize pharmacists to perform other functions, including, among other things, to furnish self-administered hormonal contraceptives, nicotine replacement products, and prescription medications not requiring a diagnosis that are recommended for international travelers, as specified. Additionally, the bill would authorize pharmacists to order and interpret tests for the purpose of monitoring and managing the efficacy and toxicity of drug therapies, and to independently initiate and administer routine vaccinations, as specified. This bill also would establish board recognition for an advanced practice pharmacist, as defined, would specify the criteria for that recognition, and would specify additional functions that may be performed by an advanced practice pharmacist, including, among other things, performing patient assessments, and certain other functions, as specified. The bill would authorize the board, by regulation, to set the fee for the issuance and renewal of advanced practice pharmacist recognition at the reasonable cost of regulating advanced practice pharmacists pursuant to these provisions, not to exceed $300. (http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB493) (Accessed: 4/30/2020).<br>
Major Implications of SB 493<br>
Provider Status: For decades, the pharmacy profession has been one of the few health care professions lacking the designation of “provider” in statute – until now. SB 493 officially declared that pharmacists are “healthcare providers.” This change creates new and exciting reimbursement opportunities as payers increasingly recognize the importance of utilizing pharmacy services to improve health and wellness.<br>
Pharmacy and Disease Management: Moving our healthcare system from a focus on “sickcare” to a focus on “healthcare” requires a far greater emphasis on managing patients with chronic diseases. SB 493 added language to the law explicitly stating the pharmacists’ role in disease management and prevention.<br>
Advanced Practice Pharmacist: SB 493 created a new category of pharmacists in California – the Advanced Practice Pharmacist (APP). Pharmacists who meet the necessary criteria for the APP designation will have unique prerogatives. These include the ability to perform patient assessments, to refer patients to other providers and to operate as a collaborative drug therapy management pharmacist outside of hospital walls. The state board of pharmacy delineates the requirements to be considered as an APP.<br>
Hormonal Contraception: Existing law allows a pharmacist to furnish emergency contraception. SB 493 expands a pharmacists’ authority to now allow for the furnishing of hormonal contraception.<br>
Nicotine Replacement Products: SB 493 authorizes pharmacists to furnish prescription nicotine replacement products.<br>
Travel Medications: SB 493 authorizes pharmacists to furnish travel medications as called for by the CDC.<br>
Ordering Tests: SB 493 authorizes pharmacists to order tests related to managing a patient’s medication regimen.</p>
<p>While the law has been in effect for the past six years, the practice of pharmacy has yet to catch up fully. This is partly due to the healthcare business model and insurance reimbursement process, followed by a lack of awareness among prescribers and healthcare institutions. The situation is, however, changing as pharmacy organizations are advocating for increasing responsibility not only at the state level but also at the federal level. More needs to be done at an individual level by practicing pharmacists as they continuously demonstrate the value of their education and training by improving the care of their patients.<br>
Our prayer is that our Doctors of Pharmacy will bring about the health of both body and soul: “My heartfelt prayer for you, my very dear friend, is that you may be as healthy and prosperous in every way as you are in soul” (3 John 3:2, Phillips).</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Vascular endothelial injury: Common element in the cellular &amp; molecular pathogenesis of GI ulceration &amp; COVID-19</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Sandor Szabo<br>
<em><br>
School of Medicine, American University of Health Sciences, Signal Hill/Long Beach, CA USA</em></p>
<p>The initial tissue injury induced by chemicals &amp; microbes (e.g., bacteria, viruses) is often investigated only in epithelial cells, since no functional &amp; morphologic methods were available to look for damage in vascular endothelial cells. In the rapidly progressing investigations during the initial stages of “gastric cryoprotection” research in the 1980s, our laboratory was the first to use Evan’s blue extravasation &amp; monastral blue labeling of damaged endothelial cells in gastric subepithelial capillaries, arterioles &amp; venules. We demonstrated increased vascular permeability &amp; morphologic damage in vascular endothelial cells occurring before the appearance of gastric hemorrhagic erosions that could be prevented by pretreatment with small doses of prostaglandins or antioxidant sulfhydryls (Szabo et al., Science, 1981; Gastroenterology, 1985; Pihan et al., Gastroenterology, 1986; Trier et al., Gastroenterology. 1987).</p>
<p>Based on these initial &amp; our subsequent studies on the role of VEGF/VPF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, which was first called Vascular Permeability Factor, since it increases vascular permeability) in the pathogenesis &amp; healing of gastroduodenal ulcers &amp; ulcerative colitis (UC), we predicted (figures on left) that VEGF/VPF may play a role in the development of pulmonary edema in severe COVID-19 patients. Indeed, subsequent, independent clinical studies found elevated levels of VEGF/VPF in the blood of these patients &amp; administration of neutralizing anti-VEGF improved clinical conditions. New results demonstrated that endothelial cells also have ACE-2 receptors that bind the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that initiate the cascade of ‘cytokine storm’ which causes extensive damage to vascular endothelium not only in the lungs, but also in the brain &amp; myocardium, often leading to microinfarcts &amp; stroke (figures on right, modified from Science, 2020). Conclusion: Our initial experiments in animal models of GI ulceration &amp; new clinical studies demonstrate a critical role of early vascular injury not only in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcers &amp; UC, but also in the development of multiorgan lesions in COVID-19.</p>
[AUHS Editor’s Note: We marvel at, and are appreciative of, the research that enables physicians to treat diseases such as COVID-19. At AUHS we seek to follow the model of “preach and heal” as modeled for us by Jesus: “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people” (Matthew 9: 35). As Dr. Charles Fielding, the author of the book Preach and Heal, wrote: “Health strategies are for every disciple regardless of background. By ministering with loving hands to individuals and imparting the Gospel, the potential to transform entire communities ensues.” We may not all be researchers like Dr. Szabo, but we can all preach and heal with the goal of transforming our community.]

Among the services provided were health screenings, vaccinations (Covid and flu), eye exams, and dental hygiene education. Some 400 low-income families and senior citizens representing the diverse community of Signal Hill and Long Beach received free groceries including chicken, canned vegetables and rice. Over 100 children received new and used books and free pumpkins which they could decorate at the arts and crafts booth. There were also groups providing mental health services including the United Cambodian Community center. It was there that I learned that there is no word for stress in their language, but its effects were evident in the health issues the Cambodian community face.<br>
It is the mission of AUHS to make a positive impact on the stressed and hurting people around us, especially underserved minorities such as the Cambodian community of Long Beach. I could see from the warm smiles and positive atmosphere of the fair on Saturday that the university was indeed meeting the needs of the community around it. AUHS also does research in the area of stress; the dean of our medical school, Dr. Sandor Szabo has published on stress and was a student of the noted stress researcher, Hans Selye.<br>
As a Christian university we ultimately look to Christ as the answer to stress and all the needs of those around us: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). It is His Spirit and His example that empowers us to serve.<br>
With the support of:<br>
• Superior Grocers who sponsored the pumpkin patch and delivered wholesale groceries to our event;<br>
• Walgreens who provided vaccines and pharmacist time free of charge;<br>
• the UCLA Stein Eye Institute which provided glaucoma screening and eye exams;<br>
• the Tessie Cleveland community services corps who brought their mental health awareness game van;<br>
• Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures who donated dental kits;<br>
• VSP Global who donated comprehensive vision exam and eyewear; and,<br>

<p>– AUHS nursing student volunteers worked alongside AUHS faculty and staff to distribute Acts of Love grocery. 400 low-income families and senior citizens helped with fresh groceries: 15 lbs of chicken, canned vegetables, 3 lbs of apples, 10 lbs of potatoes, 2 lbs of rice, grape juice, 5 lbs of carrots<br>
– AUHS SOP PharmD students assisted Walgreens pharmacist vaccinate flu and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, which was overseen by SOP faculty.<br>
– AUHS Cohort 27 community outreach class helped with event setup, registration, blood glucose screening, blood pressure tests, dental hygiene education and games for children, and TB, smoking cessation, diabetes and hypertension education.<br>
– New and used library books were given to over 100 children that attended the book fair. Many children attend Title 1 elementary schools in the area.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 19, 2021, was a day filled with God’s blessings and grace. Although it was a very busy and productive day with three concurrent events, those who are underserved and in need were able to receive opportunities to help themselves and their families.</p>



<p>One of the concurrent events was&nbsp; AUHS Foundation’s Acts of Love event. Held as a quarterly event, Acts of Love provides free groceries and food supplies for the underserved population. Attendees began lining up before 7:00 AM and many of them were senior citizens. AUHS staff and student volunteers handed out fresh groceries to 400 families in less than one hour. Each box of food included a whole chicken and ten lbs. of leg quarters, ten lbs. of potatoes, five lbs. of carrots, a bag of rice, and canned vegetables. Our youngest volunteer, Matthew (age 9) helped hand out canned corn. Since there was a great need for groceries, supplies ran out which was a first in the history of the Acts of Love events. In result, Pastor Gregory Johnson, AUHS Co-Founder, distributed $20 to each person who was not able to receive groceries.&nbsp; We want to thank our local partner, Superior Grocers corporation, for providing 10% discount on the groceries and store #119 for delivering the groceries to AUHS Foundation.</p>



<p>Along with our Acts of Love event was the COVID vaccination clinic. 50 people were vaccinated with the option of Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. AUHS’ Master of Science in Nursing students, preceptor Ms. Maria Shearing, School of Pharmacy students, and preceptor Dr. Sara Kim vaccinated clients. In addition to getting $20 cash from Pastor Johnson to cover any transportation costs, vaccine recipients entered a raffle to win prizes,. Congratulations to Mr. Wilfredo for winning 2 Disneyland tickets and to Mr. Doroteo for winning 4 Knott’s Berry Farm tickets &amp; parking voucher! We would like to extend our appreciation and thanks to Dr. Thi Dang and the San Gabriel Medical Pharmacy for supplying the vaccines.</p>



<p>Lastly, the university library staff held an on-site PubMed training for community members. The university was awarded the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Grant for 18k back in September 2020, which will mainly go towards equipment for academic programs, student use, and participant compensation. At these community outreach events, AUHS students demonstrated to participants on how to find reliable health information using the Internet and the NLM database.</p>

 MPJE vs. CPJE,https://news.auhs.edu/mpje-vs-cpje/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image.png,Articles,"
<p>By: Elaine Nguyen, PharmD, MHA</p>



<p>To practice as a licensed pharmacist in California, an individual must first pass two exams: The North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the California Practice Standards and Jurisprudence Examination for Pharmacists (CPJE). And the CPJE is considered by many to be one of the hardest pharmacy law exams in the United States. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike California, most states require their pharmacist candidates to take the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) for licensure. The MPJE is designed to assess candidates’ application of laws and regulations for specific states/jurisdiction; whereas the CPJE is designed to assess candidates’ application patient medications and outcomes, and pharmacy operations. One of the main differences between the exams is that the MPJE is based on a national blueprint of pharmacy jurisprudence competencies and the CPJE is more specific to California law and clinically based. Between October 2020 to March 2021, the CPJE and NAPLEX overall pass rates were 50.8% (710/1397) and 88% (1078/1225) respectively. The average pass rate for the CPJE is typically between 47-58%, while the average for the MPJE is between 77-84%.</p>



<p>With the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE), each jurisdiction/state write, review, and select the exam items, and item sharing is optional across jurisdictions. Unlike the CPJE, individuals who successfully pass the MPJE are eligible to transfer their existing pharmacist license to one or more states or jurisdictions. Currently, 46 states including the District of Colombia (DC) require passing of the MPJE in order to practice or transfer licensure; and 37 states including DC do not require applicants wishing to transfer their license to take the original examination.</p>



<p>On April 30, 2021, the California Board of Pharmacy unanimously approved a recommendation to switch California Practice Standards and Jurisprudence Examination for Pharmacists (CPJE) to Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE). The change over to the new test may occur after the Office of Professional Examination Services (OPES) conducts its official audit of the CPJE. What does that mean for pharmacy students or licensed pharmacists seeking to practice in California? Doctor of Pharmacy programs in California may have to change their curriculum or pharmacy law courses to prepare their students for the MPJE. This may also make it easier for pharmacists practice out-of-state to get their California Pharmacist license.</p>

<p>Everyday is a new day to start anew. When we wake up in the morning and are able to breathe, we must thank God for giving us the breath of life and for everything that He has provided for us. One bad day should not deter you from seeking God and His guidance. In fact, allowing those bad experiences overwhelm you is what will cloud you with spiritual instability. Lamentations 3:22 states:</p>



<p>“Because of the Lord’s great love, we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. I say to myself, ‘The Lord is my portion; therefore, I will wait for Him.'”</p>

<p>So, do not be afraid of the negativity and outside voices that interject. These aspects will only be temporary and God has the power to take those away if you put your utmost trust and faith in Him.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p>Do God’s great works in His name and glory. As the one and only true God, He will bestow great things and His promises onto us. A simple denial does not determine your worth and it should not deter you from pursuing your dreams and goals even further. In fact, these denials and rejections will even make you stronger. And with the addition of your faith in God, the promises that will be given to you will come by a ten-fold. Genesis 18:13 states:</p>



<p>“And the Lord asked Abraham, ‘Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Can I really bear a child when I am old?’ Is anything too difficult for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you – in about a year – and Sarah will have a son.'”</p>

 ‘Long COVID-19’: International Collaborative Study Initiated by AUHS,https://news.auhs.edu/long-covid-19-international-collaborative-study-initiated-by-auhs/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Picture1.png,Articles,"
<p>By: <em>Sandor Szabo, MD, PhD, MPH</em></p>



<p>Professor, American University of Health Sciences, Signal Hill/Long Beach, CA</p>



<p>In medical/clinical terminology, diseases by onset and duration are usually categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute illnesses generally develop suddenly and last often only a few days. Subacute diseases usually last 5-14 days, while chronic conditions develop slowly and may worsen up to 3 months or longer.</p>



<p>The new infectious disease COVID-19 (<strong><u>co</u></strong>rona<strong><u>vi</u></strong>rus <strong><u>d</u></strong>isease – 20<strong><u>19</u></strong>) caused by SARS-CoV-2 represents a challenge not only for treatment, but also by definition of its duration. Namely, as we learned in 2020, most of the COVID-19 patients who develop signs and symptoms of the disease (e.g., fever, fatigue, respiratory challenges) will eventually recover in about a week. During the last about 10 months, however, scientific reports appeared in medical literature describing many COVID-19 patients who developed long-lasting sequelae that are not only related to the respiratory tract but may involve almost any organ; most symptoms occurring in the central and peripheral nervous system. &nbsp;These conditions have been called long-hauler syndrome, or ‘post-acute disease’ or long-COVID-19, and the most preferred designation appears to be ‘long-COVID-19’. But since this is just not a simple disease like pneumonia or myocardial infarction or stroke, but a constellation of many waxing and waning symptoms, it is more appropriate to call this a syndrome, i.e., ‘<strong><u>L</u></strong>ong <strong><u>C</u></strong>OVID-19 <strong><u>S</u></strong>yndrome’ (LCS). &nbsp;In LCS fatigue, body aches, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, headache, and loss of taste or smell could persist for 4-8 weeks, after the initial, acute COVID-19, or if the patient recovered, these and other signs and symptoms may come back in 4-8 weeks. The <em>neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms</em> of LCS are probably the most prevalent and severe, and may include fatigue, myalgia, headache, cognitive impairment (‘brain fog’), while anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and PTSD occur in 30-40% of COVID-19 survivors. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of neuropsychiatric complications involve microvascular thrombosis, immune dysregulation, and inflammation.&nbsp; Other organ systems involved in LCS include the respiratory, cardiovascular, hematologic, gastroenterological, endocrine, and renal systems. The recently published report in the prestigious <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> journal (May 2021) on the 6-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes in more than a quarter of million survivors of acute COVID-19 revealed dramatic increases in intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, dementia, and neuromuscular junction disorders that may explain, at least partly, the fatigues and weaknesses LCS patients experience:</p>

<p>Since LCS requires a lot more multidisciplinary investigations, especially from public health and preventive perspectives, we at AUHS, in collaboration with Drs. Pantelina Zourna Hargaden, Nils Lambrecht, John Schloss, and Deron Herr,&nbsp; applied for grants and initiated a large international collaborative study of ‘Long COVID-19’. The international collaborators are virtually all our formal colleagues, coworkers or students in 4 countries in Europe (e.g., Greece, Hungary, Germany, Ukranie), 2 countries in Africa (Ghana, South Africa), Malaysia and Mexico. The main goals of this 3-year prospective study is (1) to establish and compare the prevalence and incidence of new cases of LCS in these countries and USA; (2) identify potential nutritional deficiencies (e.g., zinc, selenium, niacin, thiamine) in LCS patients; (3) to find potential therapeutic and/or preventive measures for acute or chronic forms of COVID-19. This large international collaborative study is just another example of AUHS addressing local issues, but also reaching out globally.</p>

 Prioritizing Drug Security in Hospital Pharmacies,https://news.auhs.edu/prioritizing-drug-security-in-hospital-pharmacies/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drug-1-600x403.jpg,Articles,"
<p>By: Dr. Christine Han, School of Pharmacy</p>



<p>In the healthcare industry, the top priority is always safety. Historically, this was recognized over 50 years ago when the Poison Prevention Packaging Act was enacted, requiring various household substances to be in child-resistant, tamper-evident packaging. Important regulatory health agencies support this idea. According to the FDA, tamper-evident packaging is defined as “having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred.” Furthermore, USP Chapter &lt;797&gt; also weighs in on this idea, recommending the use of tamper-evident packaging to add an additional measure of security.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drug-1-1024x678.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18750"" width=""490"" height=""324"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drug-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drug-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drug-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drug-1.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px""></figure>



<p><strong>Understanding Security Challenges</strong></p>



<p>While tamper-evident packaging seems to be an obvious necessity in community pharmacies, its importance may not be realized in hospital inpatient pharmacies. To better understand diversion, the BD Institute for Medication Management Excellence commissioned KRC Research, a global public opinion research consultancy, to conduct a national survey of more than 650 hospital executives and providers to better understand hospital-diversion perceptions, behaviors, and solutions. The results showed that 85% of providers are concerned about hospital drug diversion and 50% report observing suspicious activity, but fewer than 20% believe it is a problem in their own facility.</p>



<p>Hospital pharmacies incorporate tamper-evident packaging to mitigate drug diversion. Oftentimes, when controlled substances are compounded into IV formulations, specific tamper-evident locks are required for syringes. In cases where the entirety of the drug is not used, there is rigorous documentation to ensure it is all accounted for.</p>



<p><strong>Industry Groups Support Drug Safety</strong></p>



<p>Key organizations also promote safe medication practices through the issuance of guidance documents. For example, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists has issued guidelines on preventing medication errors in hospitals. While not specifically related to tamper-evident packaging, these guidelines address the importance of medication packaging in maintaining safety. To minimize errors, the guidelines recommend strategies for using look-alike medications; some of these techniques include purchasing products from different manufacturers in different-size containers and storing the drugs in separate areas. Other bodies, such as the International Health Facility Diversion Association, also promote medication safety and mitigate diversion.</p>



<p><strong>Tools to Defeat Diversion</strong></p>



<p>Private industry also has a stake in bolstering drug security. International Medical Industries (IMI), for example, promotes pharmacy productivity and safety while it simultaneously works to prevent drug diversion. IMI offers a product line known as Prep-Lock™ Tamper Evident Caps, which is designed to optimize safe drug delivery by providing tamper-evident sealing for drug-delivery devices. Prep-Lock™ Tamper Evident Caps include protection for various drug formulations and devices, such as IV syringes, medication cassettes, and IV bags. This product line reduces the risk of compounded sterile preparations becoming compromised during storage and transportation.</p>



<p>The importance of products such as IMI’s Prep-Lock™ Tamper Evident Caps cannot be understated; they offer a simple yet incredibly effective mechanism for standardization of drug protection. As the healthcare industry continues to battle drug diversion and contamination, IMI’s Prep-Lock™ Tamper Evident Caps may help to strengthen drug-security programs.</p>

<p>On June 2, 2021, several AUHS faculty members and staff visited Long Beach Rescue Mission (LBRM) to administer health surveys and consultations for patients/community members. Faculty from the AUHS School of Pharmacy guided and helped establish plans to provide additional healthcare services to the underserved and homeless populations, and gathered preliminary data for further research and study. This ensured to develop a better understanding between the caregiver-patient relationship.</p>



<p>The event was organized by AUHS, AUHS Foundation, and Mr. Robert Probst, who is the Executive Director of Long Beach Rescue Mission and holds nearly 20 years of experience working with rescue missions. Through this blessed and wonderful opportunity gifted by God, AUHS is very excited for many upcoming opportunities and prospects with LBRM so that those who are in need can receive the proper care and love in God’s name.</p>

<p>God has a plan for all of us. It is always a “Yes” and an “Amen”. His promises to me and you are going to occur and come true. In fact, doubting God will create judgment, which will fall on those who do not believe His Word and works. His Word is literal and set in stone. It will never perish or disappear because His presence and legacy is almighty and all-knowing. 2 Corinthians 1:20 states:</p>



<p>“For all the promises of God are ‘Yes’ in Christ. And so, through Him, our ‘Amen’ is spoken to the glory of God. Now, it is God who establishes both us and you in Christ. He anointed us, placed His seal on us, and put His Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of what is to come.”</p>

<p>So, do not allow others to deter you from keeping your promises. Man can break promises in the blink of an eye, but God’s Covenant and promise reigns and stays forever.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p>Believing in God is securing your faith and trust in Him. When that relationship with God is met, it is a confirmation that there is hope and dependence on Him. Life is not a smooth-sailing experience and will always throw a curveball but to overcome those hurdles, we need God and His word to lean on and look towards to. The moment when we entrust in God is when we realize that we really need Him. John 14:11 states:</p>



<p>“Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me – or at least believe on account of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever <strong>believes</strong> in Me will also do the works that I am doing. He will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask Me for anything in My name, I will do it.”</p>

<p>So, trust and believe in the Heavenly Father, for He will give you answers and the guidance to overcome hardships, tribulations, and trials. It is only a matter of time when great things will happen, all thanks to God.</p>

<p>Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. In the United States, it is estimated about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancer, and about 1 in 8 women (13%) will develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetime (https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics). It is well known that breast cancer is genetically and epigenetically not just one disease but a diverse group of diseases with diverse clinical features. Most breast cancer (about 81%) is invasive cancer, and it can be further classified into four subtypes as Liminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like, depending on the presence of hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Basal-like breast cancer is commonly known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) because the majority of cases lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and overexpression or amplification of HER2.</p>



<p>TNBC is generally larger in size, initially of higher grade, exhibits lymph node involvement at diagnosis and is biologically more aggressive than other breast cancer subtypes. TNBC accounts for roughly 15-20% of all breast cancer cases, but it represents over 50% of mortality in breast cancers. Current endocrine and hormone targeted therapies are not viable for TNBC, and the main treatment options are chemotherapy and radiation. TNBC patients tend to have higher clinical response rates to chemotherapy, but they have higher rates of distant recurrence and a worse overall prognosis than women with other breast cancer subtypes. In addition to poor prognosis and higher recurrence rate, there is lack of molecular targets, making TNBC as a long-lasting orphan disease. TNBC is associated with health disparity because it is more common in premenopausal women of African-American and Hispanic than Caucasian American women, and African-American women with TNBC have a higher incidence, disease stage, and metastasis than Caucasian American. Recently, the immunotherapy, Atezolizumab in combination with nap-paclitaxel is approved for PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. In addition, PARP inhibitors such as Olaparib or Talazoparib are currently approved for TNBC patients but only with BRCA mutations. The newly approved therapeutics result in improved and promising outcomes but unfortunately, only limited TNBC patients could have benefits from the new therapeutic regimens. Therefore, finding a new molecular target and effective treatment is the utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>My name is Jane Castillo Gutierrez, a mother of 4 beautiful kids.</em></p>



<p><em>I came here to the U.S. in 2007 as an immigrant, being new to the states. It’s hard to figure out what’s going to be our future. I went to school to become an LVN and became licensed in 2010. I was a very dedicated student when I was at school pursuing my LVN.</em></p>



<p><em>I only missed half a day of my full one-year course, due to my son graduating from the 6th grade. As soon as his graduation finished, I told my son that we cannot celebrate his graduation because we don’t have enough money.</em></p>



<p><em>I dropped off my son back to our house and went back to my school to catch up on my lecture that I missed. 8 years after I got my LVN license, I told myself that I want to go back to school again for my BSN. I had been receiving letters from AUHS and one time, I decided to call them. At that time, Ms. Dina from the Admissions Department was very helpful and very informative.</em></p>



<p><em>I decided to go see the school. There I met Ms. Alma at the front door. She encouraged me to pursue my career and she told me all the good things about AUHS and the tutorial assistance they have. Soon enough, I was enrolled back in 2015 and started my nursing journey at AUHS. 3 ½ years was a rough time for me due to working and going to nursing school full-time. In addition, I have a 2-year-old daughter and my husband was unemployed due to an injury at work, and I was the only one working at that time.</em></p>



<p><em>Ms. Alma Pineda saw all my hardships, and there were many times when I just needed someone to listen to me and to cry on. She knew when I was struggling to pay my tuition fee, and I was always behind on my payment. She is very helpful and understanding, and always gave me advice; continue going and always believe in myself. She always encouraged me to pray and ask God for guidance.</em></p>

<p><em>With the help from the AUHS administration and faculty, I was able to finish my full 3 ½ years in the BSN program without failing any classes.</em></p>



<p><em>I also want to shout out to the best clinical instructor that I had.</em></p>



<p><em>Ms. Kristen Soegeng was one of my first clinical instructors. She was very helpful and gave us all the information and the tools we needed to help us succeed in our clinical rotation. Ms. Kristen is very professional and helpful to all her students. She wants all her students to understand the context of the lecture as we applied it to real-world patient care, and how to identify the proper interventions that our patients need. Kudos to Ms. Kristen Soegeng for being a vital part of AUHS and making a great contribution to all the students.</em></p>



<p><em>Because of all the hardships and experiences that I encountered during nursing school, I told myself that I will give back to my patients. I took care of my patients like the way I wanted my loved ones to be taken care of.</em></p>



<p><em>In March 2021, I received the DAISY AWARD from ORANGE COAST MEMORIAL. One of my patients’ family wrote a very nice story about me on how grateful they are and felt safe whenever they have me as a nurse for their grandfather. I am very humbled to receive this prestigious award for nurses and am very grateful that AUHS became a part of my journey.</em></p>

 Importance of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,https://news.auhs.edu/importance-of-vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mom.jpg,Articles,"
<p>By: Dr. Jasen Chau, PharmD</p>



<p>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system in the United States for potential safety issues with licensed vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) jointly oversee VAERS (FDA). Reports of vaccine-related adverse events (potential side effects) are accepted and evaluated by VAERS. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS. Even if it is unclear if the vaccine caused the adverse event, patients, parents, caregiver, and healthcare providers (HCP) are recommended to report it to VAERS. HCPs are also required to record some adverse occurrences following vaccination.</p>



<p>One of the major drawbacks of VAERS data is that it cannot tell if the vaccine is to blame for the reported adverse event. This constraint has produced some ambiguity in the publicly available VAERS data, particularly in terms of the number of reported fatalities. There have been cases where reports of deaths following immunization have been misunderstood as deaths caused by the vaccines. This has caused immense irreparable damage to the campaign to increase vaccinations and return to any sense of normalcy re-opening businesses, schools, concerts, and many other gatherings.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mom.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18716"" width=""234"" height=""208""></figure>



<p>VAERS has several advantages, including the ability to identify potential vaccination safety concerns that require further investigation using more sophisticated data systems, the ability to accept reports from anybody, and the data being publicly available. However, there are significant limitations: VAERS reports sometimes lack details and may contain inaccuracies; the number of reports may increase in reaction to media attention and greater public awareness; and data cannot be used to estimate adverse event rates.<br>For COVID-19, some fear that this may make it easier for people to spread misleading information. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) removes data that are blatantly false, such as a recent report supposedly made by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro regarding an adverse occurrence in a beach volleyball star. And intentional, misleading reporting to VAERS, which is a federal crime, appears to be uncommon. “We have no indication that there is widespread fraud or gaming,” says Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of CDC’s Immunization Safety Office, which oversees VAERS.</p>



<p>For policymakers to make sound decisions that affect a large population, all scientific data must be communicated accurately. Only then will the public be safe, and the epidemic will be brought under control. To ensure that all lives are protected, science and research must continue to advance. The future appears bright and hopeful when accurate and honest data is available.</p>

He has already declared that no weapon or enemy will come up against us. Isaiah 59:19 states:</p>



<p>“So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against Him.”</p>

 Many Features of the SOP,https://news.auhs.edu/many-features-of-the-sop/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-4-600x403.png,Articles,"
<p>By: Dr. Elaine Nguyen, School of Pharmacy</p>



<p>The AUHS School of Pharmacy (SOP) provides a variety of opportunities for pharmacy students to explore the different aspects of the pharmacy profession. For example, the SOP offers a number of elective courses with experts in the field. One of the courses offered is the Emergency and Disaster Preparedness course where guests are invited to speak about their experience in the field.</p>



<p>On April 20, 2021, Dr. Susana Leung, member of the Disaster Medical Assistant Team (DMAT) shared stories of her deployment since 2002. Among her many deployments include the World Trade Center at ground zero in New York (2001), Super Typhoon Pongosna in Guam (2002), Hurricane Harvey in Houston (2017), National Guard Disaster Medical Workshop in Ukraine (2004), and to alternative care sites in El Centro, California to assist during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Her message to the students is “to serve others, then seek the opportunity to learn; to travel to see the world and experience different cultures.”</p>

<p>On May 18, 2021, Clifford Young, current President of the California Pharmacists Association (CPhA) came as a guest speaker to the elective course to provide medical emergency training to the students. Students were taught to perform and prioritize levels of care at a trauma scene, and to develop a mindset and plan of action as a first responder. A student in the course mentioned the session being useful because they learned how to prepare a medical kit in case of a disaster.</p>

<p>Finally, on June 1, 2021, Dr. Shannon Manzi, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, and the Director of Clinical Pharmacogenomics Service at Boston Children’s Hospital spoke to the class about her experience as a disaster responder and assisting in medication safety to the public, specifically during the Boston bombing in 2013 and the unaccompanied minor crossing deployment in Nogales, Arizona (2014). The stories she shared had an everlasting impact to the students, and she reminded the students, “No good deed goes unpunished, to always be ready but know what you are getting into, and to always remember the importance of self-care.”</p>

 Medication Non-Adherence and Bipolar Disorder,https://news.auhs.edu/medication-non-adherence-and-bipolar-disorder/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image.png,Articles,"
<p>By: Dr. G.S. Shankar, School of Pharmacy</p>



<p>Medication non-adherence is a major problem in chronic psychiatric disorders (Mert et al., 2015). Although various psychiatric disorders follow a relapsing-remitting pattern, bipolar disorder (BD) has a higher frequency of relapse, and the relapse risk remains constant throughout a patient’s life (Jawad, 2018). Although some patients with BD have long periods of recovery, long term follow-up shows that on average, patients are symptomatic around 50% of the time (Judd et al., 2003). During much of this time, patients suffer from subsyndromal symptoms (Judd et al., 2003), but even low symptom levels are associated with impaired psychosocial functioning (Ruggero et al., 2007). Bipolar disorder is associated with a range of well-described types of cognitive dysfunction across clinical subgroups,&nbsp;including patients with euthymia (Lima et al., 2018),&nbsp;and there is evidence of progression of dysfunction over time (Samame et al., 2014). Deficits are present across all cognitive domains including memory (Bourne et al., 2013). Studies with euthymic (normal mood) BD outpatients have examined the relationship between cognition and medication adherence. One major study of 353 euthymic outpatients found a relationship between poor inhibitory control and reduced adherence (Correard et al., 2017). Medication non-adherent patients with BD have lower levels of insight compared with medication adherent patients (Jawad et al., 2018). Medication non-adherence is a common problem in BD and is strongly associated with decreased cognition, lack of insight, and poorer clinical outcomes, and it also increases the need and cost of mental health services.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18702"" width=""302"" height=""329"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image.png 327w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-276x300.png 276w"" sizes=""(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px""></figure>



<p>Prophylactic medication, ideally supported by psychosocial intervention, is regarded as the basis of managing BD (Goodwin et al., 2016). The enhancement of medication adherence is a central point for therapy in many psychosocial interventions for BD (Depp, 2008). In a review of the effectiveness of psychotherapy for enhancing medication adherence in BD, seven of 11 clinical trials reviewed showed positive effects on medication adherence,<sup> </sup>with a greater effect found for multi-component interventions that focused on medication adherence (Sajatovic et al., 2004), and multi-component intervention is the foundation of this study.</p>



<p>There are several research publications that emphasize the effects of a brief psycho-educative cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT) focusing on mindfulness on medication adherence to prevent relapse in patients with bipolar disorder. It is speculated that participation in a psycho-educational program based on ‘Brief Mindfulness Centered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy’ (BMCBT) can improve medication adherence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Medication Safety – Deprescribing in Older Adults,https://news.auhs.edu/medication-safety-deprescribing-in-older-adult/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-600x403.png,Articles,"
<p>Dr. Lee Meyer, PharmD, BCGP, FASCP &lt; FCPhA</p>



<p><em>Any new symptom in an elderly patient should be considered a drug side effect until proven otherwise.</em></p>



<p><em>— J. Gurwitz et al. Brown University</em></p>



<p>Around the world, Deprescribing Networks are emerging to address the large number of medications that are being prescribed to older adults. The term ‘deprescribing’ refers to the process of evaluating a patient’s drug regimen for the continued need for each medication and discontinuing any that no longer present a clear benefit or may even present a risk.</p>



<p>Scott and colleagues<sup>1</sup> describe the process this way in JAMA: A systematic process of identifying and discontinuing drugs in instances in which existing or potential harms outweigh existing or potential benefits within the context of an individual patient’s care goals, current level of functioning, life expectancy, values, and preferences.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18696"" width=""376"" height=""376"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4.png 640w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-300x300.png 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-150x150.png 150w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-100x100.png 100w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-140x140.png 140w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-500x500.png 500w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ecb830ac3f4b8d2f662da36ee61e1bf4-350x350.png 350w"" sizes=""(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px""></figure>



<p>Deprescribing is not about denying effective treatment to eligible patients; rather it is a positive, patient-centered intervention, requires shared decision making, informed patient consent, close monitoring of effects – the same process applied when a drug is prescribed.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Polypharmacy, the term describing the large number of medications taken by an individual, is ill-defined as a technical term, but when applied to a group of patients drives the question “What medications are potentially unnecessary for this patient?” Some practitioners establish an arbitrary number to define the threshold between polypharmacy and non-polypharmacy, and 5 or more medications is a common threshold spoken of. Nonetheless, the concepts of drug-drug interactions, cumulative side-effects, anticholinergic burden, unnecessary drugs (from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)) are well-defined and well-understood. These and other concepts related to medication safety are at the core of the term “polypharmacy”.</p>



<p>Any process defined as deprescribing is an attempt to eliminate the real or potential risks associated with polypharmacy. A representative process includes the following considerations:</p>



<ol type=""1""><li>Determine all medications being taken by the individual and the reason for each:<ol><li>Include prescription and non-prescription medications and supplements.</li></ol><ol><li>Confirm how the medications are being taken.</li></ol><ol><li>Perform a mediation reconciliation process to identify any medications not currently prescribed but are being taken.</li></ol><ol><li>Eliminate any drugs on hand that are not part of the current regimen.</li></ol></li><li>Assess for potential risk factors:<ol><li>Use validated tools (ex: the current Beers Criteria and other tools).</li></ol><ol><li>Identify any current or past toxicities.</li></ol><ol><li>Apply patient factors such as age, renal function, cognitive status, geriatric syndromes, comorbidities, substance abuse, multiple prescribers, past or present non-adherence.</li></ol></li><li>Assess each drug in the current regimen for<ol><li>valid indication</li></ol><ol><li>risks of continuance based on evidence</li></ol><ol><li>identify any high-risk combinations of drugs</li></ol><ol><li>effectiveness</li></ol></li><li>Determine which medications can be discontinued or reduced in dose (one drug at a time is recommended) and continue to monitor the patient for emergence of any symptoms</li></ol>



<p>Polypharmacy is often brought about by uncoordinated healthcare, inattention to the patient as a whole and inadequate assessment of symptoms. This can lead to a “prescribing cascade” – the prescribing of a drug to treat the adverse effects of another.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/images-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18697"" width=""328"" height=""184""></figure>



<p>Pharmacists, physicians and other prescribers in the hospital, long-term care and community setting are embracing the concept and practices involved in deprescribing and developing deprescribing algorithms, protocols, policies, and procedures for reducing polypharmacy. Payors are interested since medication-related problems are a frequent root cause of hospital admissions and re-admissions. Education of patients is important in this process as well. Stopping a medication that they have relied upon for a long time may not be safe in their minds. As with any health care intervention, compassion for the person and a patient-centered approach will serve the patient and the prescriber well.</p>

 Prescribing Deprescribing,https://news.auhs.edu/prescribing-deprescribing/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-3.png,Articles,"

<p>Do you remember your first math class? Probably for most of us, the first math lesson was how to add numbers. Once you learned how to do addition, then you must move on to the next level; how to do the subtraction. At this point, you may get what I am trying to say with my title “Prescribing Deprescribing.” If we learned how to add prescriptions as a pharmacist, then we also need to learn how to deprescribe medications for the patient’s benefit. A medication given to the right patient, right dose, and right time may not be right anymore at some point.</p>



<p>There is so many evidence that demonstrate the need of appropriate discontinuation of certain medications. In a recent session at the American College of Cardiology, a scientific report showed that nearly 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure also take a medication that could be elevating their blood pressure, such as antidepressants, NSAIDs, oral steroids, certain oral contraceptives, and common decongestants. Considering about half of the hypertension patients are not well controlled with their blood pressure, appropriate deprescribing or a safer substitution must impact the patient’s outcome. Another study reported that about half of the patients taking certain medications failed to timely stop them, including antidepressant, bisphosphonates, and PPIs. If you search “polypharmacy” in any search engines, you will easily find many other factors that can contribute to the unnecessary polypharmacy problem.</p>



<p>So, the evidence is telling us that there are too many medications prescribed, but not enough monitoring is following. Pharmacists are trained to review and manage the patient’s medications including prescription, over-the-counter, and supplemental medications. Pharmacists also know well the power of appropriate patient education which will certainly decrease the use of unnecessary prescriptions. However, in a recent survey of pharmacy students, about 40% of students said that they are not exposed to the concept of deprescribing. Considering the lingering problems with polypharmacy and lost benefits of the patients, it is necessary to reinforce the pharmacy curriculum regarding the concepts of deprescribing and its process in a systematic way.</p>

<p>Lymphocyte proliferation requires more than 17 different essential nutrients. Cell division by lymphocytes is the first step in the immune response to pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. This process of amplifying the number of reactive immune cells is the basis of both humoral (B lymphocyte -&gt; plasma cells, antibody production) and cell-mediated response (T lymphocyte -&gt; killer cells). Evaluation of nutritional insufficiencies by their limitation of cultured lymphocyte replication revealed that 98% of Americans are deficient for one-or-more essential nutrients, and 25% have insufficient levels of five-or-more nutrients. Low levels of zinc or selenium alone correlate with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity from COVID-19. Low levels of zinc also increase the risk of cancer and psychiatric disorders, such as depression. Thus, a proper intake of dietary nutrients is essential to good health. Since almost everyone lacks at least one or more components from their diet, AUHS has begun several research projects to develop new methods to rapidly detect, quantify, and prevent nutritional deficits of dietary (epigenetic) and genetic (individual) origin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes, it just takes a bit of shaking to wake us up and lead us back on the right path. Everything that occurs is a reminder that God is providing us His blessings. He will always shake us up to raise us up. A strong foundation is needed and necessary for us to stand firm with God. Psalms 46:1-7 states:</p>



<p>“Our God is a our strong house of refuge, and He is found to us our helper always in times of trouble. Therefore, we will not fear when the Earth quakes and the mountains quake in the heart of the seas. Their waters shall be troubled and return and the mountains will be moved by His strength. The streams of the rivers will rejoice in The City of our God: it is the holy place, the dwelling of The Highest. God is within it; it will not shake. God will help it at daybreak. The nations raged and the kingdoms moved, He raised His voice and the Earth shook. Lord Jehovah of hosts is with us and our helper is the God of Jacob.”</p>

<p>If we keep God in front of us, He will make us greater than before. Our security with God is similar to a signet ring, in which He places us on His finger and with that security, we will never fall off from Him. It is up to God’s judgment to determine and see if we are willing to perform His good works. Amidst all of the shaking that takes place, we must rejoice higher and become stronger than before.</p>

<p>With the things that are going on in our daily lives, life continues on. God plans everything for us for good reason, despite the challenges and negativities that are weighing us down. If you trust in God, never doubt Him. Because if we wholeheartedly trust in God, we do not have to worry about the changes that are being made. Proverbs 22:17 states:</p>



<p>“Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise, apply your mind to my knowledge. For it is pleasing when you keep them within you and they are constantly on your lips. So that your trust may be in the Lord.”</p>

<p>To have trust is to have faith. Trust is synonymous with faith. God is still and always going to be worthy of our trust because He trusts in us to trust in Him. In fact, not being able to understand God’s plan is God’s plan for us. It means that we have to rely on Him with devotion and obedience. Everything that we do is based on our trust in Him.</p>

<p>Commitment to their community drove many pharmacists to go above and beyond their usual standard of service to ensure patients had access to crucial medicines as fear of infection with COVID-19 kept many older patients from leaving home. In other cases, the local pharmacist became the only healthcare professional patients could see in person as clinics and hospitals instituted pandemic precautions.&nbsp;<br><br>Many independent pharmacists reported that their pharmacies now delivers 90% of its prescriptions, as many of his patients remain afraid to leave their homes because of COVID-19. That comes to about 150 prescriptions every day.</p>

<p>A survey published by the NCPA June 1 found that 82% of community pharmacists expect to continue expanded home delivery and curbside service.<br><br>Community pharmacists also plan to continue other services that they began to offer or enhanced in the last few months.<br><br>While three-quarters of the pharmacists surveyed had not provided point-of-care testing prior to the pandemic, 61% anticipated that they and other local pharmacies would test for a variety of illnesses going forward. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services authorized testing for COVID-19 at pharmacies in April, and about 70% of states had changed their regulations to permit testing at pharmacies by early June.<br><br>Testing represents just one aspect of the expanded scope of practice pharmacists have seen over the last few months, and many anticipate that they will perform more healthcare services on a regular basis.&nbsp;<br><br>Additional services include offering vaccinations, which had been authorized in many states before the pandemic. In 2019, 73% of community pharmacies offered immunizations, but only 25% provided more than the influenza vaccine. When a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is developed, many pharmacists expect to add it to their services. In late May, Minnesota passed the first law in the nation allowing pharmacists to administer the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine when one is approved.<br><br>More than half of respondents to the NCPA survey expected more pharmacies to provide immunizations. This would be a great time to start offering an expanded range of vaccines, as the CDC has reported a sharp drop in immunizations among children during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>I cannot seem to find the part</em></p>



<p><em>Though the wound had just been made</em></p>



<p><em>My eyes were hurt, so I did depart</em></p>



<p><em>To seek Him at the grave</em></p>



<p><em>When I came unto His sepulcher</em></p>



<p><em>Only linen did I find</em></p>



<p><em>My remorse and sorrow overcame me</em></p>



<p><em>What hopes I felt divine</em></p>



<p><em>It wasn’t until I saw His hands</em></p>



<p><em>And felt also there His side</em></p>



<p><em>That I finally was able to understand</em></p>



<p><em>Where I believe The Lord abides</em></p>



<p>Starting a prayer by giving appreciation, gratitude, and thanks is a great way to acknowledge God’s works. Our faith is not based upon what other people are saying about us. In fact, we cannot base our faith around the noise that is surrounding us. The hardships that we experience and endure are thrown at us because those challenges only make us become more strong, empathetic, merciful, and understanding. Hebrews 11:6 states:</p>



<p>“And without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him.”</p>



<p>Having foolish faith is better than having no faith at all. Any ounce of faith is the beginning to forming a relationship with God and solidifies our trust in Him. In result, we must diligently seek God because the more diligent we are to Him, the more faith that we can build up. God birthed us and made us fruitful with ambitions, aspirations, and dreams. Going back to God is the first sign of igniting our faith. So, have that mustard seed-sized faith and do not be afraid or hesitant to seek God. Ascribe your success to God and He will reward you.</p>

<p><em>To soar, to rise, high above</em></p>



<p><em>The greatest University because He truly loves</em></p>



<p><em>You &amp; Me</em></p>



<p>It is important to spend alone time with God because it builds and strengthens our personal relationship with Him. God is watching us as we go through the waves of doubt and uncertainty. To help ourselves feel and believe the solid and firm foundation that God constructs for us, we just simply have to pray and acknowledge His presence and power. Going to places of desolation and refuge means that God is there waiting for us to have a conversation with Him, so that we will not forget. Mark 6:31 states:</p>



<p>“And he said to them, ‘Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest for a while.’ For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.”</p>



<p>We belong to God through and through. He wants us to find Him and to feel comforted when we are in pain. Whether it is early in the morning or late at night, it is never too late to seek God. In fact, the peace and reassurance that we receive from God is a feeling of protection and security. Although our struggles and challenges may intervene, they will only make us stronger and the last call always arrives when God is about to bless us. </p>

 Development of the Hydroxyquinoline Analogue YUM70 as a Novel Inducer of ER Stress in Pancreatic Cancer,https://news.auhs.edu/development-of-the-hydroxyquinoline-analogue-yum70-as-a-novel-inducer-of-er-stress-in-pancreatic-cancer/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2-328x403.png,Articles,"

<p>Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest human diseases, and there are two first-line regimens for patients with pancreatic cancer. These regimens of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX have shown a survival benefit but at the expense of significant side effects. In addition, developing resistance and lacking response to the treatments limit the use of the first-line regimens. Therefore, there is urgent need to develop novel treatment options to overcome the current problems such as drug resistance.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""328"" height=""521"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18644"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2.png 328w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2-189x300.png 189w"" sizes=""(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px""></figure>



<p>Glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78) is a key molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a master regulator of ER stress signaling. Cancer cells are highly proliferative and have high demand for protein synthesis and folding, which results in significant stress on the ER. In order to respond to the ER stress and maintain the cellular homeostasis, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) that promotes either survival or apoptotic death. Cancer cells utilize the UPR to promote survival and growth.</p>



<p>Dr. Yang majorly contributed in development of the hydroxyquinoline YUM70 analogs as novel ER stress inducers that bind GRP78 and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>, demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer. Also, the preparation and conjugation of fluorescent dye, BODIPY-NH<sub>2</sub> and PROTAC degrader was performed by Dr. Yang to confirm the direct molecular target of YUM70 and the efficacy of PROTAC degrader in pancreatic cancer cells. The plausible mechanism of YUM70-mediated cell death involves the allosteric inhibition of GRP78 activity, leading to an increase in ER stress and induction of protein levels of UPR target genes such as PERK. Therefore, YUM70 treatment causes prolonged ER stress-mediated apoptosis by induction of PERK/ATF4/CHOP-mediated cell death in pancreatic cancer cells. &nbsp;</p>

<p>By: Dr. Sara Kim, PharmD</p>

<p><strong>Introduction/Background:</strong></p>



<p>Since March 2020, many states have ordered residents to stay home and limit social interaction until further notice to try to slow the spread of COVID-19. Among&nbsp;adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk.&nbsp;With the Centers of Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) recommendation for older adults to stay home and social distance, it is difficult for older adults to see their health care providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To continue providing care&nbsp;for the most vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic, American University of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy has set up an innovative telehealth service as an introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) rotation. Students on the IPPE rotation&nbsp;remotely deliver&nbsp;medication management through telehealth platforms. Pharmacy students develop individualized care plan in collaboration with the patient. The care plan&nbsp;consists of intended goals of therapy and follow-up&nbsp;to determine patient outcome. Patient education is another component the students will provide during the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>



<p>AUHS SOP pharmacy students are provided with a list of&nbsp;seniors who currently reside in Providence Gardens in Long Beach, CA. Provide Gardens is an apartment for seniors 62 years and older, with low to extremely low income. With 234 active residents, Providence Gardens’ service coordinator work with AUHS to provide a comprehensive wellness program and services including preventative care, health screenings, patient counseling, and medication therapy management.</p>



<p>With the list of Provide Gardens residents, students conduct an initial call to collect a comprehensive list of the residents’ medications (including prescription, non-prescription, vitamins, and herbal supplements).&nbsp;During the initial call, the students will also inquire about the residents’ wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each initial call can take between 10 to 20 minutes.&nbsp;The medication&nbsp;list is documented and housed in a web-based software, AASC Online, that is accessible to the residents’ service coordinators, and pharmacy and nursing students. In addition to housing the medication list, the platform also house documentation of services provided,&nbsp;progress notes, intake log,&nbsp;outcomes tracking, real-time reporting,&nbsp;service&nbsp;referrals,&nbsp;and pharmacy, physician, specialist, and&nbsp;insurance information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After collecting the patients’ medication list,&nbsp;students ensure each patient’s medications&nbsp;are individually assessed to ensure appropriateness&nbsp;for the patient, effectiveness for the medical condition,&nbsp;and&nbsp;safety (including black box warnings and drug-drug/food interactions).&nbsp;The process of assessing each medication and developing goals of therapy can take up to one day since the students are in the initial stage of the pharmacy curriculum. Students utilize resources such as Micromedex, Beers Criteria, and disease-specific guidelines to develop their care plan.</p>



<p>Their assessment is reviewed and discussed with clinical pharmacists prior to the second follow-up call. Other students on the IPPE rotation are also included in the discussion and are encouraged to provide comments, suggestions, and feedback.</p>



<p>A week after the initial phone call, students will call the resident back with their assessment, recommendation, and goals of therapy for the patient. Each call is conducted on speaker in class so students can learn from their peers. Facilitation of the discussion and phone calls in a classroom setting promotes teaching and learning experience for other students.</p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<p>Final care plans are reviewed by the clinical pharmacist and documented in AASC Online. Medication-related problems and interventions are also documented as part of the data collection.</p>

<p>“….We&nbsp;are actively seeking manuscripts that&nbsp;highlight clinical pharmacists&nbsp;who are providing&nbsp;patient care using telehealth.&nbsp;This themed issue will address&nbsp;innovations&nbsp;that highlight&nbsp;clinical pharmacy services, including comprehensive medication management, using telehealth technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>…address&nbsp;improving the health of populations,&nbsp;enhancing the experience of care for individuals, reducing the per capita cost of health care&nbsp;(most likely cannot do this), or improving the care team experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>I want to be forever Yours</em></p>



<p><em>My home, my house, one You adore</em></p>



<p><em>A lineage that fulfills all Your creeds</em></p>



<p><em>And is set towards those in need</em></p>



<p><em>I want You to build a house that’s true</em></p>



<p><em>That serves, dedicates, and worships You</em></p>



<p><em>A house that aspires to do what’s right</em></p>



<p><em>And seeks Your face day and night</em></p>



<p><em>I want a castle that Yours alone</em></p>



<p><em>Where in its halls and rooms, You roam</em></p>



<p><em>To decide what is next, You will bring to pass</em></p>



<p><em>And considers my knowing, not at the last</em></p>



<p><em>I want to forever belong to You</em></p>



<p><em>And serve You, My God, because it’s true</em></p>



<p><em>You Are My Lord</em></p>



<p>A house of God is a house of faith and worship. In order to build up and strengthen a house, we must look towards God. To serve the Lord better, not only are we sons and daughters of God, but we have to act as instruments to do His good works and make a difference in His name and glory. Therefore, we must exercise our power. The grace of God is to make us work and to gain and receive His blessings. Ephesians 2:19 states:</p>



<p>“So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In Him, you are also being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.”</p>



<p>In result, we are a living temple because God’s breath is inside us. The proper time when we feel that we are being uplifted is not through ourselves wholly, but through God. In the midst of commotion, there will be a promotion. God is the carpenter, contractor, and the architect of our hopes and dreams because seeking Him more will only solidify us as His soldiers.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

 Virus Variants and the Urgency of Vaccinations,https://news.auhs.edu/virus-variants-and-the-urgency-of-vaccinations/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image.png,Articles,"
<p>By: Dr. Jasen Chau, PharmD</p>



<p>With SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, shutting down businesses, places of worship, schools, and restaurants throughout the United States for more than a year, there is still much to learn and understand about this respiratory disease. This latest coronavirus has been transforming the world since the end of 2019. Many scientists are working rapidly to determine the molecular and genetic sequence of this disease so that drugs and vaccines can be created.&nbsp; And yet, viruses (and many bacteria) have found ways to evade the many methods and drugs humans use to fight this disease, as they do in nature.</p>



<p>COVID-19 cases were first reported in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of central China, in late December 2019. &nbsp;Hubei was not the only place where the virus spread rapidly. The region was cordoned off by Chinese authorities, who also implemented mitigation measures across the country. &nbsp;Local spread of the virus was under control by April 2020, but COVID-19 had become a pandemic, with cases reported in over 100 countries.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18621"" width=""429"" height=""240""></figure>



<p>The new SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa are causing new concerns.&nbsp; Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies currently in use may be ineffective against the new forms.&nbsp; To avoid further hospitalizations and injuries, this race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible is becoming increasingly necessary.&nbsp; This method of evading current vaccines and treatments causes mutations to accumulate and grow at a pace much faster than we can manage.&nbsp; By vaccinating more people more rapidly, the immune system will be able to react and generate antibodies that will neutralize the current strain more effectively before mutations occur.</p>



<p>According to Dr. David Ho, MD, lead author and Director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, blood samples from inoculated people with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were less effective at neutralizing the two new versions.&nbsp; The 6- to 8-fold decrease in neutralizing activity with the South Africa variant is more concerning, even though the approximately 2-fold loss of neutralizing activity against the UK variant is unlikely to have any major effect.&nbsp; Even the efficacy of monoclonal antibody drugs against these variants is dwindling.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-1.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18622"" width=""239"" height=""218""></figure>



<p>Physical separation and masking, as well as preventive campaigns, hand sanitization, and vaccination, must continue. Stopping the virus from spreading would prevent new mutations from developing.&nbsp; We must continue to study, understand, and research on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against these variants to stop the global pandemic and return to some sense of normalcy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>They want your garden to go away</em></p>



<p><em>Because they’re no longer here to pray</em></p>



<p><em>For what the Father gives to you</em></p>



<p>We must believe that God has a plan for us. The more that we do to serve God in His Kingdom, the more that He will bless us. As soon as we begin to doubt or question ourselves, that is the moment when we are beginning to lose faith. Therefore, we must always look to God for reassurance and security. In fact, what we see and believe is what we ultimately serve. If we already acknowledge that God is faithful and devoted to us, why can’t we do the same? We have to only see what is true in God’s eyes. Isaiah 42:5 states:</p>



<p>“This is what God the Lord says – He who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the Earth and its offspring, who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who walk in it: I, the Lord, have called you for a righteous purpose, and I will take hold of your hand. I keep you and appoint you to be a covenant for the people and a light to the nations.”</p>



<p>God’s Word is true and eternal. The scripture of His Word and voice are not outside voices or noises. They are the Truth, the Way, and the Light. Be excellent in everything that you do for the Lord, for you will receive His blessings and rewards for your righteous deeds.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

 SB-493 Implications for the Profession of Pharmacy,https://news.auhs.edu/sb-493-implications-for-the-profession-of-pharmacy/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pharmacist-600x403.jpg,Articles,"
<p>Author: Dr. Arjun Dutta</p>



<p>Dean, School of Pharmacy</p>



<p>California has always been a bellwether state when it comes to the practice of pharmacy. The PharmD degree took root in California and was first awarded in California in the 1950s. The Golden State took the lead yet again, to advance the practice of&nbsp;pharmacy, with the passage of SB-493.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is Senate Bill 493 and what does it mean for a pharmacist? The California Senate Bill No. 493 was signed into state law on October 1, 2013 and it added various components to the professional designation and job functions of a practicing pharmacist. Heretofore, pharmacists were not considered as healthcare providers and their job function and reimbursement were relegated mostly to the administration orally or topically, drugs and biologicals pursuant to a prescriber’s order. Furthermore, pharmacists could administer immunizations pursuant to a protocol with a prescriber and furnish emergency contraception drug therapy pursuant to standardized procedures if they have completed a training program.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pharmacist.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18612"" width=""432"" height=""288"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pharmacist.jpg 615w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Pharmacist-300x200.jpg 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px""></figure>



<p>The Senate Bill No. 493 vastly adds to the pharmacists’ repertoire of services that is commensurate to their training and degree. The following is a summary of the bill and its provisions:</p>



<p><em>This bill, instead, would authorize a pharmacist to administer drugs and biological products that have been ordered by a prescriber. The bill would authorize pharmacists to perform other functions, including, among other things, to furnish self-administered hormonal contraceptives, nicotine replacement products, and prescription medications not requiring a diagnosis that are recommended for international travelers, as specified. Additionally, the bill would authorize pharmacists to order and interpret tests for the purpose of monitoring and managing the efficacy and toxicity of drug therapies, and to independently initiate and administer routine vaccinations, as specified. This bill also would establish board recognition for an advanced practice pharmacist, as defined, would specify the criteria for that recognition, and would specify additional functions that may be performed by an advanced practice pharmacist, including, among other things, performing patient assessments, and certain other functions, as specified. The bill would authorize the board, by regulation, to set the fee for the issuance and renewal of advanced practice pharmacist recognition at the reasonable cost of regulating advanced practice pharmacists pursuant to these provisions, not to exceed $300. </em>(<a href=""http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB493)%20"">http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB493) </a>(Accessed: 4/30/2020).</p>



<p>Major Implications of SB 493<a href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a></p>



<p><strong>Provider Status</strong>: For decades, the pharmacy profession has been one of the few health care professions lacking the designation of “provider” in statute – until now. SB 493 officially declares that pharmacists are “healthcare providers.” This change will open up new and exciting reimbursement opportunities as payers increasingly recognize the importance of utilizing pharmacy services to improve health and wellness.</p>



<p><strong>Pharmacy and Disease Management</strong>: Moving our healthcare system from a focus on “sickcare” to a focus on “healthcare” requires far more emphasis on managing patients with chronic diseases. SB 493 adds language to the law explicitly stating the pharmacists’ role in disease management and prevention.</p>



<p><strong>Advanced Practice Pharmacist</strong>: SB 493 creates a new category of pharmacists in California – the Advanced Practice Pharmacist (APP). Pharmacists who meet the necessary criteria for APP recognition will have unique authorities. These will include the ability to perform patient assessments, refer patients to other providers and operate as a collaborative drug therapy management pharmacist outside of hospital walls. The state board of pharmacy delineates the requirements to be considered as an APP.</p>



<p><strong>Hormonal Contraception</strong>: Existing law allows a pharmacist to furnish emergency contraception. SB 493 expands a pharmacists’ authority to now allow for the furnishing of hormonal contraception.</p>



<p><strong>Nicotine Replacement Products</strong>: SB 493 authorizes pharmacists to furnish prescription nicotine replacement products.</p>



<p><strong>Travel Medications</strong>: SB 493 authorizes pharmacists to furnish travel medications as called for by the CDC.</p>



<p><strong>Ordering Tests</strong>: SB 493 authorizes pharmacists to order tests related to managing a patient’s medication regimen.</p>



<p>While the law has been in effect for the past six years, the practice of pharmacy is yet to catch up fully. This is partly due to the healthcare business model and insurance reimbursement process, followed by a lack of awareness among prescribers and healthcare institutions. The situation is however changing as pharmacy organizations are advocating for increasing responsibility not only at the state level but also at the federal level. More needs to be done at an individual level by practicing pharmacists as they constantly demonstrate the value of their educational and training by improving the care of their patients.</p>

<p><em>Where is the place where you do dwell</em></p>



<p><em>Let me arise and go until </em></p>



<p><em>I have shown, to you, my love</em></p>



<p><em>Not just in part, more than most think of</em></p>



<p><em>Where is that place where you do sleep</em></p>



<p><em>Arise, I’ll go and cover keep</em></p>



<p><em>Watching, make certain, you slumber well</em></p>



<p><em>My devotion, towards you, grows and swells in me</em></p>



<p>The more that God blesses you and me, we have to consider this question: What can we do more for God? Anything that takes away our blessings from God is an issue that prevents us from being devoted to Him. The more that we do for God, the more that we are in check with Him. We are the house and the living temple of God. It is so important to be and stay devoted to Him, and it requires for us to be set apart from everyone else. Deuteronomy 13:16 states: </p>



<p>“And you are to gather all its plunder in the middle of the public square, and completely burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. The city must remain a mound of ruins forever, never to be rebuilt. Nothing devoted to destruction shall cling to your hands, so that the Lord will turn from His fierce anger, grant you mercy, show you compassion, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers, because you obey the Lord your God, keeping all His commandments I am giving you today and doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord your God.”</p>



<p>Therefore, speak blessings over your loved ones out loud, so that God will prosper over you. How much do we really want His blessings and consecrations? Being lukewarm for God isn’t enough. In result, we need that fiery passion and desire for Him. God is going take care of us because everything we have is connected to Him. His answers and responses for us are always a “Yes” and an “Amen”.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>How I long for you to stay</em></p>



<p><em>‘Til this work is done</em></p>



<p><em>For you and I to enjoy The Way</em></p>



<p><em>God blesses us through His Son</em></p>



<p><em>But, now I know that you must part</em></p>



<p><em>Though it saddens my heart so</em></p>



<p><em>But, know that we are one, we two</em></p>



<p><em>You’re forever in my heart</em></p>



<p>As we grow, there are always places for change and improvement. Life takes us in many directions and sometimes, they are unexpected. We have to keep in mind about all the things that came before and become excited for the things to come. God is looking at us to see how hard we are working to prepare and develop the plans that are in store for us. We must always believe that God loves us infinitely and unconditionally. The hope and the expectations are that we have to cherish and value every moment that He brings us. The pledges and promises that are made should not be broken. Proverbs 27:9 states:</p>



<p>“Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice.”</p>



<p>God is our Father, our Provider, and our Protector. He is also our Friend. Friendships and relationships can come and go, but our friendship and relationship with God is eternal. It can never be broken, weakened, or damaged if we just put our utmost devotion and faith in Him.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>There is greatness in the Kingdom</em></p>



<p><em>Amongst even the least</em></p>



<p><em>There is power and favor</em></p>



<p><em>Success and increase</em></p>



<p><em>For when God chooses</em></p>



<p><em>Calls His judge from the cave</em></p>



<p><em>He prepares their success</em></p>



<p><em>Makes the least thought of, brave</em></p>



<p>When do you find yourself in a position of fear and worry? Perhaps you find yourself in these emotions during the most inopportune times. Fear is an emotion that can never completely vanish. However, fear can diminish greatly with the help, guidance, and protection of God. In the Bible, David found himself in a position of uncertainty when he faced Goliath. Despite Goliath’s enormous height, strength, and suit of armor and weaponry, what he did not have was faith in God. 1 Samuel 17 states:</p>



<p>“David said to the Philistine, ‘You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day, the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day, I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and He will give all of you into your hands.'”</p>



<p>With only a sling and a stone, David struck Goliath, knocking him to the ground, and later on beheading him. Although David was smaller in height and did not possess strong armor and weaponry, he declared God’s name which solidified his faith in Him. Therefore, we should take David’s declaration into a modernized context. The challenges that are brought upon us may cause us to become fearful and worried. But, if we put our trust and faith in God, He will give us the guidance and assurance that we need. </p>

<p><em>Let our home be filled with Your care</em></p>



<p><em>Filled with Your grace because You’re here</em></p>



<p><em>Let our home be filled with Your love</em></p>



<p><em>Filled by Your Spirit, from above</em></p>



<p>“Home is where the heart is.” It is just so important to God invite in and to bless the home(s) that we are in. Home is our refuge and the place in our heart, mind, and soul. In result, God becomes our refuge and place in our heart, mind, and soul once He is present. If there is peace and order in the household, God’s presence and assurance is there. Without His presence, there is no structural foundation. Psalms 48:12 states:</p>



<p>“March around Zion, encircle her, count her towers, consider her ramparts, tour her citadels, that you may tell the next generation. For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even ’til death.”</p>



<p>At the end of the day, God wants us and our homes to be blessed because we are a living temple for Him. Every issue or problem that we come across is a sign for us to come forward and seek God’s help and guidance. While a house may just be a physical house and can change, our hearts must be set and firm in God’s Word.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I keep seeing in these spaces</em></p>



<p><em>Ways to offer good</em></p>



<p><em>Trying to lay aside my cares</em></p>



<p><em>Doing what I should</em></p>



<p><em>Offering to my Savior</em></p>



<p><em>Those, yet in this place</em></p>



<p><em>The best in what I’m giving</em></p>



<p><em>Knowing He sees my face</em></p>



<p>Do your best in everything that you do. Even if it is not related to your work and career, and even if no one around you may be watching, just know that God is always watching you doing what you do. When we fall down in times of hardship and turmoil, God wants us to get back up on our feet and continue to do our very best. As sons and daughters of God, He blesses us unconditionally. Therefore, it is only right if we give more to Him and exceed His expectations. Colossians 3:22-25 states:</p>



<p>“Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.”</p>



<p>Being diligent, focused, and on-point ensures that we are on the right path to God’s Kingdom. By remaining focused, we will not be led astray. Therefore, love God with all your might, with all your soul, and with all your strength.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>When we choose to keep what isn’t ours</em></p>



<p><em>It gives a place for someone to devour</em></p>



<p><em>It opens a door, or opens a gate</em></p>



<p><em>For our goods to be burned, and our Promises made, to wait</em></p>



<p>How many times have we lost faith in someone that we once trusted? Most likely, we all have experienced this more than once. It may be difficult to gain that trust again with people but with God, our trust in Him will always be steady and strong. Therefore, it is significantly important to maintain our faith and trust in Him. God’s devotion to us is reflective of His love and trust in us. It is imperative that we reciprocate our devotion back to God as well. Luke 16:10-12 states:</p>



<p>“One who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much. If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?”</p>



<p>So, don’t turn your back from God because He will never turn His away from us. In fact, turning our back from God is also reflective of how we will treat others around us; there is a lack of faith and trust. In order to develop a cohesive relationship and bond with God first, we also have to do the same with our friends, colleagues, and loved ones.</p>

<ul><li>Devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostle.</li><li>Devoted themselves to fellowship.</li><li>Devoted themselves to the breaking of bread.</li><li>Devoted themselves to prayer.</li></ul>



<p>Christian values are very important. One of the key aspects that needs to be considered and discussed is to instill faith-based values into any type of work that we do. How we reflect ourselves is to hone the holistic approach (mind, body, spirit) to practice our duties. In addition, compassion, love, and perseverance are the core components to becoming a competent leader and follower. God’s Word is the ideal model for any organization to sustain itself and create a difference. Colossians 3:12-14 states:</p>



<p>“Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.”</p>



<p>Instilling Christian-based values in your personal and professional life develops a structural foundation. The process of going forward to the next step as an organization requires compromise, teamwork, and fellowship. This is how success is implemented in the good works of God. That way, we will be able to sustain unity, peace, protocol, and structure.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>To know that you are loved by God</em></p>



<p><em>That His promise lives in you</em></p>



<p><em>To be fruitful and to multiply</em></p>



<p><em>Is what leaders will do</em></p>



<p><em>By example, do they toil each day</em></p>



<p><em>Before others stir from sleep</em></p>



<p><em>Securing forever the place, the throne</em></p>



<p><em>Where economy does keep</em></p>



<p>There are responsibilities that we have to undertake. But, with faith, which is a very important part of your relationship with God, determines how well you take charge and lead yourself to a stronger connection with God. If we really want to lead, we have to raise our loved ones up. A good leader will demand the best from people, but a good leader will also be a follower as well. Being a follower of God sets the ideal example of being a competent leader. 1 Kings 11:28 states:</p>



<p>“And with the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.”</p>



<p>If you desire power, serve others around you. Lift them up so that they can be successful in their own good deeds and works. We need to recognize the tasks that God has assigned and given to us. By taking this responsibility, we are on the path to becoming competent leaders but also following God’s wishes. </p>



<p>May God Bless You.</p>

<p><em>Matthew 23: 2-3</em></p>



<p><em>“The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law are experts in the Law of Moses. So obey everything they teach you, but don’t do as they do. After all, they say one thing and do something else.”</em></p>



<p>In the time of Jesus, there were two schools of Judaism. One line of Jewish thought and teachings followed the scholar Shammai. Shammai was a strict rule follower. The teachings of Shammai were all about following the rules exactly as written in the Torah. No matter what the circumstances, you must follow the rules. The teachings of Hillel the Elder were quite different than those of Shammai in several fundamental ways. Hillel taught that the love of your neighbor was more important than blindly following the written law. Hillel is supposed to have said, “That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.” The Shammaite Pharisees, Sadducees, and the Sanhedrin majority were followers of Shammai. They viewed Jesus as a dangerous radical and heretic because the Judaism of Jesus was in the tradition of Hillel. After the second destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, the Jewish leadership of the Sanhedrin shifted from the school of Shammai to that of Hillel. If you want to call yourself a Christian, follow the teachings of Jesus. Don’t be a Shammaite Pharisee. Compassion and love of your neighbor should guide your actions as you seek to follow the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>There are beasts who prowl</em></p>



<p><em>Who rage and tear</em></p>



<p><em>Come to take our hopes</em></p>



<p><em>While we’re unaware</em></p>



<p><em>They seek to rob</em></p>



<p><em>And to destroy</em></p>



<p><em>Make certain none</em></p>



<p><em>Of our dreams deploy</em></p>



<p><em>Unless our God rebukes them</em></p>



<p>There is an amplification of uplifting when we go forth towards God. These feelings of uplifting not only help those who are around us, but it can also help us as well. We must not measure what is seen as too little or too much. Even the littlest of blessings can make a huge impact on someone’s life. Matthew 6:19 states:</p>



<p>“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on Earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”</p>



<p>Faith is not something to be taken lightly. If we cannot be faithful over the little things, then how can we say that we are faithful over the greater things? God will multiply everything for you because He is a multiplying provider. We cannot offer “leftovers” in return to Him. We have to put ourselves in a position so that we can receive His blessings. So, remember. Have compassion in everything that we do in His Spirit.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Before we were confident, certain, and sure</em></p>



<p><em>But finding out secrets, that boldness no more</em></p>



<p><em>We often look, think ourselves incomplete</em></p>



<p><em>Unworthy of such, mayhap, unable to compete</em></p>



<p><em>But He sees us through, a fair different eye</em></p>



<p><em>That declares we are rulers, both you and yes, I</em></p>



<p>God is the one who makes us rulers who can overcome anything. In the eyes of God, we are more than good enough. We often find ourselves in a position that makes us say, “Woe is me” or “I’m not good enough to do this”. However, the dependency towards God will never go away. It is in that instant moment when we need God. Whatever problem or issue that we come across or experience, He has our back. Unconditionally and always. God wants us to go toward Him because He delights in us. Isaiah 43:4 states:</p>



<p>“Others were given in exchange for you. I traded their lives for yours because you are precious to me. You are honored, and I love you.”</p>



<p>The mission that God has given us is to lift up those who are around us. We cannot fulfill that mission with excellence and valor if we do not declare and reclaim God as God. When the challenges and struggles are present, it is those times when we need Him more. God will make us successful so that He can have us help and uplift others. As long as He is with us, He will help conquer our troubles.</p>

<p><em>More often than not, we complain</em></p>



<p><em>About the challenges and problems, we face</em></p>



<p><em>Not knowing it is part of God’s plan</em></p>



<p><em>To bring us to a better place</em></p>



<p><em>The stones, the rocks, the gravel</em></p>



<p><em>Our feet endure along the way</em></p>



<p><em>Are the very materials we’ll require</em></p>



<p><em>To build a Chapel where we play</em></p>



<p><em>Songs of victory to our God</em></p>



<p>There is a reason for everything. Any part of life is a challenge. But, God’s plan is different from our plan. In fact, His plan is even better and grander than ours! God has a way to orchestrate everything. These challenges that we are faced with is a process of looking to God without drowning or suffocating in pain along the way. The reason is that God doesn’t want us to fail or give up. This is also a way for Him to teach us that we need to learn how to rely on Him and be fit for His Kingdom. 1 Samuel 18:2 states:</p>



<p>“And from that day, Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father’s house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. And Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt.”</p>



<p>These stepping stones are a way for us to become wiser and smarter in these challenges that are thrown at us. All the problems and issues we experience become the source to a solution. Instead of avoiding these challenges, we should welcome these challenges with courage. No matter how difficult life is, we need these conflicts and oppositions in our life to help us grow into better men, women, and children of God.</p>

 COVID-19 and Stress,https://news.auhs.edu/covid-19-and-stress/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-5-600x384.png,Articles,"
<p>Author: Dr. Sandor Szabo, MD, PhD, MPH</p>



<p>Professor, American University of Health Sciences, Signal Hill/Long Beach, CA</p>



<p>Edited by: Christina Yoo, AA, BA, MA</p>



<p>COVID-19 (<strong><u>co</u></strong>rona<strong><u>vi</u></strong>rus <strong><u>d</u></strong>isease – 20<strong><u>19</u></strong>) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a new and complex infectious disease. Because of its sudden and unexpected appearance at the end of 2019 and early 2020, that found most of the countries unprepared, it’s not surprising that the new disease created a lot of confusion, panic and chaos that almost predictably led to stress. I have written an invitational review article on this topic (“COVID-19: New disease and chaos with panic, associated with stress”) in March and April 2020 that has just been published (1) <a href=""https://mspsss.org.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/281"">https://mspsss.org.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/281</a>. In this short summary, I will focus only on the stress-aspect of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Based on the original definition of biological stress by its discoverer Hans Selye, “Stress is the nonspecific response of the body to any demand made upon it” (2). Chaos and anxiety are often seen in epidemics, especially when it grows to a pandemic level. As a recent article stated, “Crisis response has always been chaotic.”:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""720"" height=""349"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18535"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png 720w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4-300x145.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></figure>



<p>By definition, stress should be caused by different factors (stressors), which elicits similar neuroendocrine changes, such as the rapidly released catecholamines and sustained, elevated levels of secreted glucocorticoids (2). The multifactorial etiology is almost given in a pandemic such as, e.g., anxiety about getting infected, what the future may bring, depression, isolation, family arguments in closed quarters, real or perceived food shortages, unemployment, (temporary) loss of income, all culminating in increased domestic violence and suicides. The more psychological, societal, and physical stressors hit us, the more serious the resultant distress reaction becomes.</p>



<p>The distress may involve all segments of the population, but the most severely affected are the healthcare workers (e.g., emergency room and intensive care unit doctors and nurses), and contact tracers. The additional stress on healthcare workers, besides almost all the other factors that hit any segment of society, are the long hours they must put in, in part because of the shortages of doctors and nurses, lack of sufficient personal protective equipment, triaging patients that cannot be saved either due to the lack of respirators or hospital beds, witnessing dying patients, etc. No wonder that in some hospitals, nurses and others demonstrate, demand improvements or even those who refuse to work to protect themselves and their families from potential exposure to the new virus. All this is compounded by the fact that thousands of doctors and nurses died worldwide, apparently in a much larger percentage than any other segment of professional people.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" width=""720"" height=""384"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-5.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18536"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-5.png 720w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-5-300x160.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px""></figure>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few remedies in the pandemic stress, and fortunately, the social media and lay press are full of stress-reduction exercises, diets, and other measures. Among these ones of the simplest, science-proven intervention is the “relaxation response” (3), meditation, yoga and the easy, seven-minute workout (4). All these should be preceded or associated with a healthy diet (with a lot of vegetables, minimal carbohydrates, and salt), plenty of hydration, daily exercise (at least 30 min of walking), breathing exercises, and (if available) plenty of sunshine. If none of these steps help, to avoid going into a deep depression or alcoholism, or domestic violence, obtaining professional help from licensed mental health experts is crucial.</p>

<p>A recent issue of <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>, the most widely read and famous weekly medical journal in the world, carries a front-page editorial on the “History of Medicine…” that covers not only the discovery of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, but in 2.5 pages, the entire history of the development of all vaccines.</p>

<p>Thus, for historical reasons, all of us in the healthcare and education field should read this short review article. As you can see from the first line, it gives credit to the Hungarian scientist <strong><u>Katalin Karikó, PhD,</u></strong> whose collaboration with <strong><u>Drew Weisman,&nbsp;MD, PhD</u></strong> led to the development of the mRNA vaccine that forms the basis for the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines… Some of us deduced the seminal work of these two scientists still in December, as outlined in my public health update from Dec. 29, 2020. &nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Why are the novel mRNA vaccines different from traditional vaccines</u></strong>? – All the antibacterial and antiviral vaccines developed so far are attenuated, weakened microbes that when injected into us, we produce antibodies which will recognize the dangerous viruses or bacteria when they enter our body, and kill or neutralize them. The creativity and originality of Dr. Kariko (who devoted her entire research career to developing mRNA-based therapeutics) has been that after last January when the genetic sequence of SARS CoV-2 has been published, along with electron microscopic pictures that the new virus attaches via its spikes to the ACE-2 receptors to animal or human cells, Dr. Kariko and other research teams focused only on the genetic sequence of spike proteins and their mRNA that encodes these proteins. Her reasoning has been that if we develop antibodies against the spikes, the virus cannot attach to our cells. In other words, by her reasoning: “Forget about the whole virus; let’s just concentrate our efforts to neutralize the spikes.” – and her ingenuity, along with technical help from Drew Weissman, MD, PhD from Boston, paid off and laid the foundation of BOTH current mRNA vaccine developments. Now, both will be nominated for the Nobel Prize.</li></ul>



<p><strong>How mRNA vaccines work</strong>. – &nbsp;As you may surmise from the above description, these vaccines don’t use the entire attenuated virus, just the SARS CoV-2 spike protein-related mRNA. Strictly speaking, only the Pfizer vaccine uses the real mRNA; Oxford-AstraZeneca chose its double helix DNA analogue which makes this more stable (stored at -4 and not -80 ℃), as you will see later. The vaccines thus contain either mRNA or DNA that when entering our immune cells, they stimulate the production of spike protein and when they are released, other immune cells recognize this as “foreign” (not part of our body) and start producing antibodies against the spike proteins. The next step is predictable: when vaccinated persons catch the real virus, their bodies have millions of ready-to-attack specific antibodies to neutralize or kill the virus. This is shown in the illustration, below:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<ul><li><strong><u>What are the differences between the Pfizer-BioNTech &amp; Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines?</u></strong> – Two major differences:<ul><li>As I mentioned above, the Pfizer vaccine contains the real mRNA of the COVID-19 virus, while the AstraZeneca applies the stable, related double helix DNA. The Moderna vaccine also uses mRNA, encapsulated in a thicker layer lipid in an oily micro-bubble – hence it’s more stable than the Pfizer variant. (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine.html</a> )</li></ul><ul><li>Pfizer uses the unstable mRNA in an oily, protein microcapsule that also contains trace amounts of polyethylene or polypropylene glycol (PPG) to which some people are allergic. Hence the reported few cases of allergic reactions – but none of those were severe and life-threatening. The Oxford – AstraZeneca scientists placed the DNA into weak adenovirus (which in virulent form may cause pneumonia) that after, vaccine injections also taken up by our cells to produce spike proteins that, when released and recognized as ‘foreign’, our B-lymphocytes and plasma cells start producing massive quantities of specific anti-spike protein antibodies.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong><u>Which vaccine is safer &amp; which one should I take?</u></strong> – This is NOT a difficult question; both mRNA vaccines (Pfizer &amp; Moderna)&nbsp;as well as the DNA-based (Oxford-AstraZeneca) variant are extremely safe and unbelievably effective (90-95%)! Compare this with the effectiveness of about 50% of our yearly flu (influenza) vaccines. Personally, I would take any of the 3, but if I had a choice, I would take the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, since AstraZeneca employs the adenoviral vector delivery system. Namely, since my research lab used this technique in our first ever demonstration of curing/healing experimental duodenal ulcers in rats by a single shot of gene therapy (either naked DNA or adenoviral vector delivering angiogenic growth factors), we know that the weakened adenovirus might turn into an aggressive virus in the body and cause pneumonia both in experimental animals and patients, as the clinical literature demonstrated). [<em>Deng XD, Szabo S, et. al… Gene therapy with naked DNA or adenoviral vector of VEGF or PDGF increases endogenous VEGF, PDGF and bFGF expression and accelerates chronic duodenal ulcer healing in rats. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311:982-988.]&nbsp; </em>Based on this date, of course, we could say that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is a form of gene therapy – applied early, to prevent diseases caused by new coronaviruses.</li><li><strong><u>Is the new mutation of SARS CoV-2 more dangerous?</u></strong> – Yes and no. Yes, it’s more infectious than previous variants (relax, more than 30 mutations have been demonstrated around the world), but we don’t know if the clinical outcome of these infections will be more severe than what we know so far from COVID-19 cases. Although the new mutations, which were first detected in the UK and South Africa, spread rapidly, are more transmissible, and apparently, are not deadlier. The other good news is (again, we know this from the often-disparaged basic science investigations) that mutations occur mostly in the base and middle, not at the tip of spike proteins that attach to our ACE-2 receptors. Thus, if the tip of spike proteins is not markedly altered, all the current COVID vaccines will be effective.</li></ul>

<p>The AUHS Foundation, in association with American University of Health Sciences (AUHS), provided free groceries for the public on Saturday, March 20, 2021. Held as a quarterly event, Acts of Love aims to give back and help those in need within the community. The need was great as evident in the queue that began to form three hours before distribution began. </p>



<p>“This opportunity is so important to my family and I because now, I am able to set food on the table for my loved ones ever since I recently became laid off from my job due to the pandemic,” stated one attendee who requested to be unnamed. Vouchers were distributed to families a week before the event with help from AUHS Foundation’s community partners. Attendees were given a variety of fresh grocery items such as frozen whole chicken and chicken leg quarters, potatoes, apples, carrots, rice, canned corn, and hand sanitizers. Because of continuing pandemic guidelines and regulations, social distancing, temperature checks and face masks were required. </p>



<p>This month’s Acts of Love was held from 11:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. at the campus parking lot of American University of Health Sciences located on 1600 E. Hill Street in the city of Signal Hill. Among those who assisted during the event were Pastor Gregory Johnson and Dr. Kim Dang – Co-Founders of AUHS, Ms. Lieu Suss – Program Director of the AUHS Foundation, and several AUHS staff and nursing students.

<p><em>When that time approaches, when we are to be sent</em></p>



<p><em>What finally has been measured, and the cloth is rent</em></p>



<p><em>Let us be mindful and perceive how grand</em></p>



<p><em>This sacrifice of that perfect lamb</em></p>



<p><em>Our Lord</em></p>



<p>There is no human being who can really bring us complete hope. It is only from and through God that He can gift us that opportunity of genuine hope. Those who have not conquered through faith and hope should reflect on the fact that the grace and goodness of God always overcomes fear and evil. As human beings, we always wait for something to happen in order for validation or for us to believe. Nothing will shake you if you have faith and hope in our Heavenly Father. Luke 23:40 states:</p>



<p>“But the other answering rebuked him, saying, ‘Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.’ And he said unto Jesus, ‘Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.’ And Jesus said unto him, ‘Verily, I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with Me in paradise.'”</p>



<p>May God Bless You.</p>

 Is Alzheimer’s Type 3 Diabetes?,https://news.auhs.edu/is-alzheimers-type-3-diabetes/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture1-600x403.png,Articles,"
<p>By: Dr. Neelima Chauhan, Professor – Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture1.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18477"" width=""479"" height=""317""></figure>



<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder currently afflicting ~6 million Americans. The vast majority (~95%) of diagnosed AD cases are of sporadic origin while only a few percentage (~5%) of diagnosed AD cases account for familial/genetic origin, indicating the importance and role played by non-genetic risk factors during the process of aging that may potentially contribute to the development of AD. Studies show the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease among people with diabetes is 65% higher than that of those without diabetes. With such a strong link, research has focused on explaining the connection between the two diseases.</p>



<p>Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease share several common abnormalities including impaired glucose metabolism, increased oxidative stress, insulin resistance and amyloidosis, contributing to overlapping pathology. The enhanced risk of developing AD in diabetic patients remains strong even when vascular factors are controlled. While insulin is neurotrophic at optimum concentration, too much insulin in the brain may be associated with reduced amyloid plaque clearance since both insulin and amyloid compete for the availability of the enzyme that degrades them.</p>



<p>In studies of people’s brains after death, researchers have noted that the brains of those who had Alzheimer’s disease but did not have type 1 or type 2 diabetes showed many of the same abnormalities as the brains of those with diabetes, including low levels of insulin in the brain. It was this finding that led to the theory that Alzheimer’s is a brain-specific type of diabetes—”type 3 diabetes.”</p>



<p>In diabetes, if a person’s blood sugars become too high or too low, the body sends obvious signs of the problem: behavior changes, confusion, seizures, etc. In Alzheimer’s disease, however, rather than those acute signals, the brain’s function, and structure decline gradually over time.</p>



<p>When a group of researchers reviewed the collections of studies available on Alzheimer’s disease and brain function, they noted that a common finding in Alzheimer’s disease was the deterioration of the brain’s ability to use and metabolize glucose. They compared that decline with cognitive ability and noted that the decline in glucose processing coincided with, or even preceded, the cognitive declines of memory impairment, word-finding difficulty, behavioral changes and more. Furthermore, scientists determined that as insulin functioning in the brain worsens, not only does cognitive ability decline, but the size and structure of the brain also deteriorate—all of which normally occur as Alzheimer’s disease progresses.</p>

<p><em>I drew near so I could hear You</em></p>



<p><em>Drew close to find Your care</em></p>



<p><em>Stayed until You knew me</em></p>



<p><em>Showed me love while I stayed there</em></p>



<p>God gave us a purpose to be here on this Earth. Our purpose is a lot bigger than we realize. It does not matter how wealthy we are, how many titles we have behind our names, or how many material items we possess. To know God first is the beginning of acquiring wisdom. What we want to do is to stay near God. We do not owe Him anything materialistically, but we owe our attention and love to Him. If other people’s beliefs are contrary to what you believe in, then they are not being like-minded. Matthew 7:7-8 states:</p>



<p>“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.”</p>



<p>If we follow God, we will not be lost. It is not for us to judge other people, but it is for us to choose wisdom. Spiritual value and the heart are very important because it determines how much faith we have in Him. We can always call upon God regarding the circumstances that we are in. So, be righteous and draw yourself nearer to God.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p>There were many industry experts including healthcare practitioners, community officials, and educators who were present at the meeting. “With the university’s strength as a faith-based institution, the SOM will be the infrastructure for quality medical education that is integrated with the aspects of human care and compassion,” stated Dr. David Rogers, a practicing orthopedic surgeon and an alumnus of Harvard Medical School.</p>



<p>“From a community lens, I believe that the School of Medicine can play a great, important role for civilians in the city and beyond,” stated Councilman Al Austin, who represents the Long Beach City Council.</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to being involved with the Advisory Board and the planning of the SOM. Aspiring, future practitioners will be able to receive knowledge and experience in medical education as well as being aware of diverse patient and equity inclusion,” commented Dr. Richard Mitchell, Professor at Harvard Medical School and a long-time colleague of Dr. Sandor Szabo, the SOM Founding Dean.</p>

<p>The mission of the SOM of AUHS is to educate and train physicians primarily from disadvantaged and underserved communities so that they can provide mainly primary care. Additionally, and most importantly, they should be able to affect positive client-patient outcomes by sharing their Christian values of love, caring, justice and respect, to fulfill the healthcare needs of the medically underserved population. With the newly established SOM in progress, AUHS extends their utmost appreciation and gratitude to God and to those who attended and are looking forward to progressions being made to the medical school.</p>

<p>On March 23, 2021, several AUHS faculty members and staff visited Long Beach Rescue Mission (LBRM). Organized by Mr. Robert Probst, the Executive Director of the LBRM, the site visitation and tour was planned for the AUHS team to receive an in-depth look at the facilities and compounds. This was ensured to develop a better understanding on how the university can provide healthcare services at LBRM to the homeless and underserved populations. The LBRM consists of 5 facilities, housing for men, women, and children, programs within housing, apprenticeships, skills and development classes, and a daily recovery program schedule. </p>

<p>The first meeting between AUHS and LBRM was held back on February 24, 2021 to discuss a potential partnership and collaboration in plans to provide additional healthcare services, administer medical treatment, and establish an on-site clinic for the homeless and underserved community. With shared and aligned beliefs in the core values and teachings of Christ, AUHS is very excited for many upcoming opportunities and prospects with LBRM so that those who are in need can receive the proper care and love in God’s name.</p>



<p>On behalf of the university, those who visited the site were Pastor Gregory Johnson (Co-Founder of AUHS), Lieu Suss (Program Director of AUHS Foundation), Dr. Deborah Leveille (School of Nursing Dean), Dr. Mok Chong (School of Pharmacy Chair and Professor, Department of Clinical &amp; Administrative Sciences), Dr. Albert Ngo (Assistant Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences), Dr. Sara Kim (Assistant Professor of Clinical &amp; Administrative Sciences), and Dr. Helen Rhee (Assistant Professor of Clinical &amp; Administrative Sciences).</p>

<p><em>Not so much looking, talking but helping</em></p>



<p><em>To show we truly care</em></p>



<p><em>We at times miss the messages, “The Word”</em></p>



<p><em>God speaks along ‘The Way”</em></p>



<p><em>Truly, I know it would be well for us</em></p>



<p><em>If we could stop long enough to pray</em></p>



<p>What we need to do everyday is to stay on track with God. The road that we are on is a long journey in life. Every time that we are in this long journey, God wants us to be at a place where we can find peace and harmony with Him. That is our destination. Our focus on other things can be so intense that we ignore our neighbors in need. We brush away the things that interrupt us, but God interrupts Himself to interrupt us. This is His reminder. Hebrews 13:2 states:</p>



<p>“Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.”</p>



<p>Everything that we possess is wrapped up in the presence of God’s love and mercy so that we can bless others. It is always the extra effort and mile that will bless us. Our job is to honor God by honoring and helping those who are vulnerable and in need.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>How can we measure our care, our giving</em></p>



<p><em>For those we truly love</em></p>



<p><em>Can it be weighed, by grams or ounces</em></p>



<p><em>Can it be measured, by feet or meters</em></p>



<p><em>Whatever we possess, is as nothing</em></p>



<p><em>If we do not care or provide comfort, and security</em></p>



<p><em>For those we <strong>love</strong></em></p>



<p>Time is truly a treasure. It gives us the chance to spend time with our loved ones. However, at the same time, time is very valuable. Sometimes, we lose track of time so we miss the opportunity to simply reach out to say <strong>Hello</strong> or <strong>I love you</strong>. Love is not measured by material items; it has to be conveyed from the heart. While love can be demonstrated by our actions, in the end, the importance of love derives from the heart. 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 states:</p>



<p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.”</p>



<p>Love, while it may be complex, has to be unconditional. Grudges cannot be held because we have to get used to the challenges being thrown at us. If we want real power and strength, we have to walk in love in God’s name first. In fact, we need this power to do the things that God wants us to do. Power is overcoming the hurdles and providing love and prayer for others. If you love, do everything in love.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>How can I forget thee?</em></p>



<p><em>Not remember, who You are</em></p>



<p><em>Think that this, all this, has happened</em></p>



<p><em>By some random, exploding star</em></p>



<p><em>How can I forget Thee?</em></p>



<p><em>When everyday You show me love</em></p>



<p><em>All the little, great ways You bless me</em></p>



<p><em>The Creator of everything from above.</em></p>



<p><em>My Maker.</em></p>



<p>We are so busy and productive on a day-to-day basis that we often forget to stop and look at God’s wonders and the beauty that He created, In result, we disregard the little, minute details that God has perfected in His craft. Everything that we go through is His work of art, and the end result and solution will be beautiful. Challenges in life are given to us by God as tests of our faith, and how we will be able to uphold and maintain our faith. The small moments of God’s craft and beauty is what we will cherish in our hearts and minds. Isaiah 51:13 states:</p>



<p>“But you have forgotten the Lord, your Maker; who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth.”</p>



<p>We may not fully understand what God is doing, what He is planning, or what He is saying to us. However, we must not be complacent and instead, actively seek out for Him. We should not afraid or hesitant to reach out to God. Because He is our Father, our Dad, and our Maker, He will always be there to listen to us.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Make us hesitate</em></p>

<p><em>That’s we’re required so much more</em></p>



<p><em>We continue on, we give our best</em></p>



<p><em>Because His Word is sure</em></p>



<p>God is our trainer and our spotter. He is blessing us constantly to make sure that the weights do not fall and crush us. God is constantly wanting us to be fit for His Kingdom. Therefore, let us not be weary or unmotivated to do the deeds that He wants us to accomplish in His name. The trials, tribulations, and challenges that we endure and experience are actually a blessing in disguise. In fact, these struggles will only lift us higher to become stronger and keep our faith in God. Galatians 6:9 states:</p>



<p>“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.”</p>



<p>When we are dealing with the hardships that life throws at us, God is the greatest interceptor of all time. If we give up instantly, it is usually during the time when life situations have become too much for us to deal with. As our eternal interceptor, God is making sure that we create a breakthrough. If we are not made to be fit for His Kingdom right now, then our blessings from Him will not come through. So, be steadfast in your plans and keep pushing on.</p>

<p><em>Take no offense</em></p>



<p><em>When you come unto</em></p>



<p><em>One seemingly unworthy</em></p>



<p><em>Not deserving your due</em></p>



<p><em>Respect not the person</em></p>



<p><em>With gold in their hands</em></p>



<p><em>For the wise will see God</em></p>



<p><em>In the palace, the poor stand</em></p>



<p>Humility is more godly than appearance in God’s eyes. The quality of our deeds is what God is looking for. All of the things and abilities that we acquire are all part of God’s plans and privileges. When we bow down to or seek man first, we are indicating who we believe and trust in more. The substance inside of us determines how we perceive and use judgment towards others who are less fortunate. God chooses and blesses whoever He wants. In the end, regardless of our identities, we are all children of God. 1 Samuel 16:7 states:</p>



<p>“But the Lord said to Samuel, ‘Do not consider his appearance or height, for I have rejected him; the Lord does not see as man does. For man sees the outward appearance, but the Lord sees the heart.'”</p>



<p>We can be in an unfortunate situation at any point. In result, we should not be so quick to judge when we see those who are less fortunate. It does not matter how insecure we are. We need that interchange and interconnection with God. Talking and communicating with Him will give us more courage and strength to push forward. Everything that we go through and endure is a blessing from God to remind us that we need Him.</p>

<p>2021 is off to a great start, as AUHS and the Southern California Chapter of the ACRP have teamed up once again to hold a virtual workshop. “Sponsor Oversight of Decentralized Clinical Trials” was held on March 10, 2021. </p>



<p>We are once again honored to have had Mr. Eric Pittman, the Program Division Director for the FDA/ORA, as the guest speaker to discuss about the latest regulatory developments that impact and involve clinical trials. The two-hour event discussed about the facilitation of decentralized clinical trials, preserving the quality of oversight, ensuring patient oversight, data collection, and clinical outcomes which was later followed by a Q&amp;A session and further information for registered attendees. </p>



<p>The university firmly believes that these types of events will bring forth awareness so that the healthcare professionals of today and of the future will familiarize themselves with regulatory practices that ensure human subject protection.</p>

<p><em>Not sure where I learned to give it all</em></p>



<p><em>Perhaps when first, I did heed His call</em></p>



<p><em>Or perhaps because I needed so much</em></p>



<p><em>Understood in my giving, I’d know of such</em></p>



<p><em>Whenever it was, I’m thankful to the Son</em></p>



<p><em>Who gave it all, so now we’ve won</em></p>



<p><em>Victory in everything we pursue</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve been led to give, because of you</em></p>



<p><em>My God</em></p>



<p>We all need to give our very best. Not just in charity, donations, or work ethics but our hearts and sense of responsibility to God. We do not want to give half-heartedly or marginally give. Therefore, we cannot say that we love God if we choose not to give enough or give it our all. Our God is a jealous God because He wants us to focus on Him and Him alone. When animal sacrifices were performed many years ago, God refused to accept blemished and flawed animals because those gifts of sacrifice were tainted. They were not the best in quality. As the Almighty Father, He deserves the best. Luke 6:38 states:</p>



<p>“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”</p>



<p>God does not force you to worship Him, but know that you must have the willingness to come forward and seek God. If you desire great things, you have to have the willingness and heart to give. Always do your best, give your best, and you will be rewarded.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Let me journey past the gate</em></p>



<p><em>That portal limited where man awaits</em></p>



<p><em>Let its doors for me open wide</em></p>



<p><em>That I might learn where wisdom hides</em></p>



<p><em>Let me venture beyond the veil</em></p>



<p><em>See into places where His knowledge hails</em></p>



<p><em>‘Til my Lord shows His mystery</em></p>



<p><em>For once imprisoned, now set free</em> </p>



<p><em>In Christ</em></p>



<p>God does indeed work in mysterious ways. The mysterious wisdom of God is connected to His Spirit. All of the things that God has planned for us is in a twist of mysterious occurrences. However, along with that mystery is His wisdom, the wisdom that knows when we will receive His gifts and blessings. The one mystery that does not exist is God’s love for us. God’s love for us is not a mystery or a secret; it is raw and real. 1 Corinthians 2:10 states:</p>



<p>“But God has revealed it to us by the Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who among men know the thoughts of man except his own spirit within him? So too, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.”</p>



<p>God speaks mysteries to us through the Holy Spirit. When we have the spirit, we are undoubtedly connected with God. What we need to consider is what God says to us, not by what man says to us. The Father allows trials and tribulations in order to raise us up and become stronger in faith than ever. He knows everything that is planned, and will reveal His blessings in His own time. While others may not know and understand the reason and result of God’s mysterious ways of fulfilling His blessings onto us, it is within these challenges because they allow us to move forward.</p>

<p><em>There are many a place, where you and I go</em></p>



<p><em>To receive counsel and guidance, when we don’t really know</em></p>



<p><em>But I suggest if you’re going, to look to Him First</em></p>



<p><em>You will find all your answers and those problems, reversed</em></p>



<p>Do not be afraid to ask for help, especially if you are seeking help from God. God does bring us His guidance, but He also brings people to us as His representatives so that they can help us in His good name and deeds. Keep your eyes open to see what is around you and surround yourself with good people. We are supposed to look to God for everything. In fact, do not seek man first. Seek God first in order to have Him or someone help you out. At the end of the day, we must go to God first. Matthew 7:7 states:</p>



<p>“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.”</p>



<p>God is our Father and to ask/seek for Him is a reflection of us praising Him. This will demonstrate your faith and trust in God. Ask Him for guidance early in our preparation to fulfill His works in His name. If you believe in God, your actions have to align with your beliefs. In fact, it is never too late to ask God for anything. So, be steadfast and quick to ask Him for anything.</p>

<p><em>There’s a sprite that seems to flutter</em></p>



<p><em>Goes to and fro about us all</em></p>



<p><em>Asks that we be worried</em></p>



<p><em>In our worry, not heed His call</em></p>

<p>Trusting in God puts our spirit and mind at ease. It is in His time and favor that He will guide and help us through the times when we are experiencing difficulties. Our faith and trust in God has to be more than ever. The only back-up and support that we will ever need is God. If we do not have Him as part of the full equation, then we really have no one to trust and in the end, nothing to live for. Proverbs 3: 5-6 states:</p>



<p>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths.”</p>



<p>Whatever and wherever you trust is what pay homage and dedicate yourself to. The place that God has put us in is based on the foundation of blessings, faith, and excellence in everything that we do. If we think that we can do anything by ourselves, then we are being ignorant and ill-minded. There is a solid reason why God exists and why He is an important part of us.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I searched about in hopes to gain</em></p>



<p><em>What similitude of joy remains</em></p>



<p><em>Whilst ‘pon this earth, each ventured day</em></p>



<p><em>That yearns for something, seemed far away</em></p>



<p><em>An endless voyage undertook</em></p>



<p><em>And futile void of Him who shook</em></p>



<p><em>Alas return to The Way I knew</em></p>



<p><em>Knowing God, I need not pursue, happiness</em></p>



<p>Happiness can be elusive and subjective. It can mean many things because there are many concepts to what brings happiness. In fact, happiness is truly being engaged with God, which brings sheer joy from the inside. Being with God delivers a sense of purpose and a fresh, new perspective on genuine happiness. In this journey called life, we search for many things that make us happy. However, it is ultimately seeking God and having faith in Him as our primary source of happiness. Ecclesiastes 2:26 states:</p>



<p>“To the person who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness.”</p>



<p>Sometimes, even the simplest of things makes us happy. Whether it is spending time with family or friends, seeing others succeed, or just smiling towards another individual, the root of happiness all goes back to God and His Word. God is our source of life, our source of inspiration, and our source of happiness. So, seek Him and His Word to make your journey shine.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>There’s a power that rests in obedience</em></p>



<p><em>It’s found in every step of “The Way”</em></p>



<p><em>It holds tight to the promise that’s given</em></p>



<p><em>Helps turn our darkness into day</em></p>



<p><em>To our Father who made everything</em></p>



<p><em>And to those He placed in authority</em></p>



<p><em>Through obedience, success He will bring</em></p>



<p>Obedience is an important aspect of what your relationship is like with God. Anybody who is disobedient towards a higher authority, the person that is placed by God, is ungodly and is actually disrespecting the decision that God made to place that person in a position of higher authority. Obedience gives us a place of power and does not take that power away from us. By being obedient, we can excel in everything that we do. Deuteronomy 28:1 states:</p>



<p>“If you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully follow all His commands I give you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations on earth.”</p>



<p>Obedience is power and we are chosen by God to do great things in life. We must rise up so that we can lift ourselves up. The God we serve is a great God, so having an unrighteous attitude and maintaining a huge ego by disobeying God and your superiors will cause you more harm than good. Know that He will bless you regardless. And be obedient to become humble and be humble to become obedient.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>There are many voices out there</em></p>



<p><em>Many loud that seek to quell</em></p>



<p><em>What our Father long has promised</em></p>



<p><em>And as His children, we should know well</em></p>



<p><em>So, whenever you see a doubting</em></p>



<p><em>Or another sign that makes you sad</em></p>



<p><em>Take heart in what He promised</em></p>



<p><em>Believe Him, it will make you glad</em></p>



<p>God always gives us signs and if we respond, we are blessed by Him. He always presents opportunities for us to grow and become better than ever. We need to pay attention to what God has given us. These outside voices are just mere distractions that will stray us away from God. Seeking Him is the way to persuade yourself. God’s voice is the voice of specificity and almighty power. His promises are always a “yes” and an “amen”. Therefore, it is really important to have a strong communication with God. In fact, we should be persuaded that God is God because He sits on the throne in the Kingdom of Heaven and blesses us. Romans 4:20 states:</p>



<p>“Yet he did not waver through disbelief in the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised.”</p>



<p>God can change any circumstance in a heartbeat. These voices from God define and reflect the promises that He is going to bestow onto us. Sometimes, the obstacles and problems that we encounter actually become opportunities. In result, we should not take the little or big things for granted. The more that God blesses us, the more that we will be able to provide and give back to the Kingdom of Heaven. So, do good and believe in His Word.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>They are wonderful and grand; these plans we have</em></p>



<p><em>They are creative and beautiful; all hopes they have nabbed</em></p>



<p><em>But compared to those, that the Father intends</em></p>



<p><em>To defer to Him, we rise, ascend, to heaven</em></p>



<p>There is so much to do in this world. What God wants for us is to fulfill a lifelong mission of doing His work and spreading His Word. It is a matter of being focused and steadfast than ever. God’s plans are always better and grander than ever. He does not want us to have less, and wants our plans to come into complete fruition. He will not deter you from your success. What is ultimately important is our personal relationship with God. Man can start the plan but God finishes the plan. Jeremiah 29:11 states:</p>



<p>“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.”</p>



<p>If we continue to have faith in God, then we have to know and trust that we are in good hands. Whatever God puts in your heart to do, He will make it come through and come true. He is bigger than anything that we are facing, and He knows what we are capable of doing. So, always look on the bright side and keep your faith in God and only God. Everything that God has planned will become a reality.</p>

<p><em>I wanted to say that I love you</em></p>



<p><em>That I think that you are grand</em></p>



<p><em>That what God has given you</em></p>



<p><em>And promised, forever stands</em></p>



<p><em>I wanted to say thank you</em></p>



<p><em>For always doing what is asked</em></p>



<p><em>For not hesitating to follow instructions</em></p>



<p><em>So that quickly, completes the task</em></p>



<p><em>I wanted to say bless you</em></p>



<p><em>For believing and having faith</em></p>



<p><em>For giving me the power</em></p>



<p><em>To say thank you without disgrace</em></p>



<p><em>I wanted to say all this and more to you</em></p>



<p>It is important to love your family and neighbors with caring words. Words can mean so much, no matter how short they can be. We become so caught up with everyday life that we often forget to stop and say words of encouragement to others around us. Saying these words of encouragement strengthens and uplifts us and our loved ones. Words of kindness nourishes the soul and creates a feeling of warmth and worth. The more we love God, the more that we can love others. Proverbs 16:24 states:</p>



<p>“Kind words are like honey – sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.”</p>



<p>So, be open with the words that you want to say. Words of constructive criticism does not mean that one dislikes the other. These words are stated out of care and concern. The mission is greater than ourselves, and that is why we have to speak for the life we are living. Everything that we need and want, God is aligning it. Delaying our words and wasting time can actually hinder us. Therefore, encourage one another and speak positively.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>They heard me complain about the rain</em></p>



<p><em>When they needed water for their crops</em></p>



<p><em>They heard me complain about the sun</em></p>



<p><em>When they wished winter would stop</em></p>



<p><em>They heard me complain about the night</em></p>



<p><em>When they desperately needed sleep</em></p>



<p><em>They heard me complain about the morning</em></p>



<p><em>When God wanted to complete, my blessings</em></p>



<p>How can we complain if God already provides us everything? We are brought into this world crying but if we leave the world still crying and throwing a fit, then we have taken God for granted all along. God’s plan for us will be better and worthwhile, even if it takes 10 or more years to wait for. To be complaining about the littlest of things implies that we are self-centered and short-minded by response and nature. Complaints do layer on top of one another if we continue to voice our dissatisfaction. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 states:</p>



<p>“Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”</p>



<p>Complaining about ongoing circumstances can actually put us in a state of disrespect towards God. He provided us with everything, but we always find an opportunity to remain displeased. Showing care and kindness towards others is what we have to do because God has always done all of that for us.</p>

<p><em>There’s a decision we all must make</em></p>



<p><em>To choose, consider, there’s so much at stake</em></p>



<p><em>If then, there’s a choice, then let us be wise</em></p>



<p><em>To choose all the blessings, God placed before our eyes</em></p>



<p>God’s blessing is what we would use the most when we are at our most vulnerable. He gives us a choice of either being blessed or cursed. For obvious reasons, we want to be blessed in order to do the right things in God’s eyes and that we believe in Him. Life is not perfect by all means and is neither good nor bad. God keeps saying to us that we must be blessed. The reason being is that He wants us to live a life that is holy, fruitful, and pleasant. Numbers 6:24 states:</p>



<p>“The Lord blesses you and keeps you; the Lord makes His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lifts up His countenance upon you and gives you peace.”</p>



<p>The acronym B.O.L.T. is a powerful one: Believe, Obey, Love, Trust. Surrender yourself to God so that you may earn His blessings. It all just takes a simple step in putting your faith and believing in Him first. So, do not delay your blessings because you are stuck in a rut or struggling financially. Trust and rely in the Lord completely with a full heart. Keep looking and searching for the blessings that God is offering you. We need His mercy, forgiveness, and favor. All of these things work together for the good.</p>

<p><em>Do what I should</em></p>



<p><em>If I could do anything</em></p>



<p><em>Let me do great</em></p>



<p><em>Excel in my giving</em></p>



<p><em>Not stall or hesitate</em></p>



<p>As we move further into 2021, we must be cognizant of doing God’s great works with the greatest nobility. The good that we are doing now has to be amplified to the next level. How we utilize doing good deeds is how we are initially connected with God. A lot of the time, the good inside of us becomes masked by daily distractions and struggles. The reason why God wants us to do good things is because He has always done good things for us. As long as we have done good intentions, we should continue to do great deeds in His name and glory. Matthew 19:16 states:</p>



<p>“And someone came to Him and said, ‘Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?'”</p>



<p>So, do good and impress your Dad. God created us for the intention to be and do good while being in a world where good and evil coexist together. We are capable of carrying out these good deeds so that it overcomes the bad. If we do more good, we have a closer walk of life with God. The good deeds that are fulfilling in life is a passport to eternal life with God in His Kingdom of Heaven.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Let me see my God I pray</em></p>



<p><em>Let me stay right where He stays</em></p>



<p><em>Let me sit there at His feet</em></p>



<p><em>Let me follow and become complete</em></p>



<p><em>Let me see my Lord this day</em></p>



<p><em>Honor Him in every way</em></p>



<p><em>Bring Him joy in all I do</em></p>



<p><em>Let me see, then become Him too</em></p>



<p>We may not see God with our physical eyes, but we can see Him through all the good works that He has done for us. Just because He is not physically there does not mean that He is never around us. In fact, God is always with us wherever we are at any time. All we have to do is put our utmost faith and trust in Him because through His power and will, anything is possible. God even manifests His own power and spirit through those who are like-minded and share similar beliefs. Exodus 33:18 states:</p>



<p>“Then Moses said, ‘Please, let me see Your glory.’ He said, ‘I will cause all My goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim the name Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.’ But He answered, ‘You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.'”</p>



<p>Therefore, see God’s works to believe in Him. With the devotion to abide by His word and an acknowledgment of His presence, God is an everlasting being who brings His blessings to us, His children, henceforth and forever.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I have seen what my Father said</em></p>



<p><em>Have seen the journey that lies ahead</em></p>



<p><em>Have felt the struggles and sorrows too</em></p>



<p><em>Still every word He said comes true, as He promised</em></p>



<p>What we have to keep our eye on is what the Father has said and where we are heading. In the end, the glory that the Father has promised will come true. What we should do is return our blessings to Him. In fact, we want to continue and keep on the promise of God. God will not let us down or leave us hanging to dry out and wait. We cannot leave or desert our preparations for a blessing because He wants us to grasp tight and hold onto it. Numbers 23:19 states:</p>



<p>“God is not a man, that He should lie, nor the son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?”</p>



<p>How many times have we ourselves broken promises, or had our promises broken by man? When it comes to God, His promises to us are planned and forever set in stone. All we have to do in return is to keep our faith strong, stable, and steadfast in Him and Him alone. If we say that we believe in God, then we must show that we believe in His good works. Promises are not fulfilled if we do not start taking action first. Do the natural so that God can do the supernatural.</p>

<p>If we are going to be excellent, we must be excellent in everything that we do and achieve beyond our expectations in the name, honor, and glory of God. We can win the race that God assigns and gives to us if we follow in His path of light and righteousness. With any road that is taken, there may be shortcuts. However, God does not want us to take any shortcuts or detours that will get us to the finish line. A shortcut or a detour aligns with the act of cheating and manipulation. In other words, sometimes, we want the easy way out. Therefore, life is never an easy journey. With success comes hardship, challenges, and a process of struggling. Despite all this, God wants for us to follow through with any task that He assigns us. 2 Timothy 2:15 states:</p>



<p>“Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.”</p>



<p>Glorify and magnify your deeds to God. He would not want us to perform any deed with a half-hearted approach and mindset. What we put into our work is our input, credibility, and what we stand for as believers and children of God. To be excellent is to develop a legacy for future generations to carry on the next assigned deed in God’s name.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I sought for what was hidden</em></p>



<p><em>There where they said it would be</em></p>



<p><em>There in the mountains of hope </em></p>



<p><em>Where first I knew of Thee</em></p>



<p><em>I rose early to take my journey</em></p>



<p><em>Carried enough to keep me ’til</em></p>



<p><em>I could enter into your presence</em></p>



<p><em>To rest because you told me well</em></p>



<p><em>Done my faithful servant</em></p>



<p>How we show our gratitude to God is to spend time with Him and play with Him. As children of God, we must have the time and will to also be with Him. Regardless of what is going to happen, God wants us to have complete faith and trust because it really pleases Him. The materialistic possessions that we acquire can disappear in a heartbeat, in a moment. However, our faith in God cannot disappear that quickly. God is always with us through the good and the bad. To Him, faith comes first above all. In result, that gives us the road map to look forward to bigger and greater things to come. Hebrews 11:6 states:</p>



<p>“And without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him.”</p>



<p>So, do good in God’s eyes and in His favor. Seek validation from God, not from man. In order to proclaim His name, be respectful and serve God in the right ways. If we love God, we must prioritize and do our very best in His name and glory.</p>

<p><em>I cannot begin to express to you</em></p>



<p><em>What my Father does, has yet done</em></p>



<p><em>What He’s granted by His mercy</em></p>



<p><em>Favor shone forth by His son</em></p>



<p><em>It’s His Spirit that keeps unfolding</em></p>



<p><em>Lifting, guiding my way</em></p>



<p><em>Such grace beyond understanding</em></p>



<p><em>Words alone could never say</em></p>



<p><em>How much I love Him</em></p>



<p>God’s grace and love for us is everlasting and permanent. The love that He provides for us should be reciprocated back to Him. Should we not love God any more than we need to? Well, we should! All of us need God’s love, and we need to show it. The reality is if we say that we love God, we have to take the time to express our utmost appreciation, gratitude, and thanks to Him. In fact, demonstrate your love for God and for others by showing your actions and deeds. John 14: 23-24 states:</p>



<p>“Jesus answered him, ‘If anyone loves me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. And the word that you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.'”</p>



<p>There is nothing in this world that does not come from God. If we believe in God more than anything, it is so important for us to give back to Him. Even when we feel that we are absent or unworthy of receiving love, seek God first. Take a few minutes out of your personal schedule and talk to Him. He is always ready to hear you and be there for you no matter what.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>And what you are doing seems to go nowhere</em></p>



<p><em>Just remember what He created and shaped you to be</em></p>



<p><em>A child of God filled with victory</em></p>



<p>Everything that God promised onto us is going to take effect. While it may take some time to fulfill, it does not mean that we should give up halfway through to perform and accomplish our duties in God’s name and glory. In fact, God would not want us to have unfinished business. Whatever task that God brings onto us is the start of a process of finishing that task until the very end. If we give up halfway through because it is challenging or difficult for us to take on, then what will that say about us if we are given more tasks in the future? Life, while it is a blessing, is not an easy walk in the park. Life does indeed have its obstacles. But, just because there is one or perhaps a few obstacles in the way, does not mean that we should give it all up at once. Isaiah 41:10 states:</p>



<p>“So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you;  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”</p>



<p>God is always with you through the good times and bad. Trust in the Lord God with your all heart, soul, and strength. This journey called life, while strenuous, is also a process of development and in bettering ourselves to become stronger and more spiritual than we already are.</p>

<p><em>Shored me up once you were done</em></p>



<p><em>Made me better than in my beginning</em></p>



<p><em>So that Salvation was what was won</em></p>



<p>The renovation that God puts us through may not be an enjoyable process. There is a lot of change and corrections that need to be made within us, and why we may not enjoy being renovated, it is for our own good. God receives the credit and glory for the transformations and changes that are taking place. He sees what we are doing at all times. Everything that He does for us is to build us up, to renovate us, to make us stronger, and to reconstruct us into better sons and daughters of the most high God. Ezekiel 36:36 states:</p>



<p>“Then the nations around you that remain will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt what was destroyed, and I have replanted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.”</p>



<p>God is our healer, engineer, contractor, and many more. Do not give up on yourself and others when God has not given up on you. In fact, He never will. When we develop bad habits, it is very important that we have to be redirected down the path that God sees fit for us. When renovation takes place, we must also take accountability and responsibility for our actions. Who we really are is not our physical selves, but our Spirit.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I laid upon my bed one night</em></p>

<p><em>Why so many things were going wrong</em></p>



<p><em>Why did I have to cry</em></p>

<p><em>He said that I needed chastening</em></p>



<p><em>‘Tis I, that He adores</em></p>



<p>To be disciplined is not to be punished by God. Rather, an act of discipline is an act of love from God and for God to have us go down the right path. God gives us unconditional love over and over again, no matter how many times we make countless mistakes. He wants us to align ourselves so that we are not straying away from what is seen as good in His eyes. If God really loves us, He is willing to constantly correcting us for our sake. And that is what He has always been doing. When He is blessing us, we are put in a position where we are receiving His love. Deuteronomy 8:5 states:</p>



<p>“So, know in your heart that just as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you.”</p>



<p>Just as how any parent would discipline their child, God – as the ultimate Father figure and disciplinarian of them all – disciplines us, His children. The teachings and word of God are sacred but very essential to our lives. Therefore, it is important to apply what He teaches us and keep His word throughout our lifetime. </p>

<p><em>Because His love for me and you, is true</em></p>



<p>Do everything to and for the glory for God. Our relationship with God determines how much we are declaring our love for and faith in Him. If we hold back, God will actually hold us accountable. In reality, God always guides us through everything that we endure and go through. What He expects from us is declaring our love for Him and His name. Be fearless and shameless when sharing and declaring your love for God. There is more to life than outside support from man. You can declare God’s name in many stages in your lifetime. In everything that we do, give God the honor and glory first. Psalms 35:27 states:</p>



<p>“Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause; yea, let them say continually. Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of His servant. And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.”</p>



<p>Our source of inspiration and strength comes from God alone. If we solely rely on God, then we need to pronounce His name out loud. What you declare about God becomes a reality. When we speak of His name, there are surrounding angels who will write of these events in the Book of Life. Therefore, be proud of being a follower and believer of God.</p>

<p><em>Our times,</em></p>



<p><em>They are in His hands</em></p>



<p><em>They may seem to turn</em></p>



<p><em>Still, He commands</em></p>



<p><em>No matter what</em></p>



<p><em>Man imagines to do</em></p>



<p><em>God’s promises are timeless</em></p>



<p><em>For me and you</em></p>



<p>Time is a reminder for all of us to know that its essence is in God’s hands. In fact, God has a special timing for each and every one of us. Time, while precious and significant, can run out quickly amidst the rush of everything and quick-paced environment. Timing in God’s control is very important, in which His promises are always a “yes” and an “amen.” A little seed cannot germinate and develop into a beautiful flower or tree if there is a lack of water and light. Without the effort and work, the seed will not be able to develop and flourish. Thus, the time that is precious is lost and away. This is parallel to our own effort and work. If we do not take the time to see how we can better ourselves to do God’s work, then our effort becomes a waste. Romans 13:11 states: </p>



<p>“And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.”</p>



<p>Therefore, make the effort to make our time worthwhile. We may never know when our time will arrive. It may be today, tomorrow, and even the forthcoming days and weeks. Be ready and prepared for what God is going to give to you soon, because whatever He will give is going to be much better than ever.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Where rests that place where we do right</em></p>



<p><em>Or the setting where, only good’s in sight</em></p>



<p><em>It is neither here, it is neither there</em></p>



<p><em>Except our Lord, whom we revere</em></p>



<p><em>So, let us be thankful for that patience won</em></p>



<p><em>Born from the blood of His wondrous Son</em></p>



<p><em>We are blessed indeed, because of this stance</em></p>



<p><em>Ours is a God, of Second Chance</em></p>



<p>Our God is a loving, forgiving God. He gives us countless chances because He is a God who does not give up on us, His sons and daughters. As His children, God is a Father who loves us unconditionally and lovingly. If we fail to be on top of our actions and do not prioritize them first, we are not doing God’s deeds correctly in His eyes. Unfortunately, it is very easy to revert back to old habits and acts. God is a reminder that He is there to catch us if and before we fall. John 21:15 states:</p>



<p>“When they had finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?’ ‘Yes, Lord,’ he answered, ‘You know I love you.’ Jesus replied, ‘Feed My lambs.’ Jesus asked a second time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love Me?’ ‘Yes, Lord,’ he answered, ‘You know I love You.’ Jesus told him, ‘Shepherd My sheep.’ Jesus asked a third time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love Me?’ Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, ‘Do you love Me?’ ‘Lord, You know all things,’ he replied. ‘You know I love You.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed My sheep.'”</p>



<p>Therefore, be steadfast in what you do and focus on the details. God gives the best and asks the best from us because He gives us second chances. If we have not done enough for Him, then we have not tried and done enough for Him to begin with. As a merciful Father, He continuously draws us with His cords of love. </p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I keep looking for a healing</em></p>



<p><em>To take this pain away</em></p>



<p><em>Keep trying to find a cure for</em></p>



<p><em>What seems to linger and to stay</em></p>



<p><em>Then I realized what I needed</em></p>



<p><em>Was to go unto, my Liege</em></p>



<p><em>Stop trying to do it myself</em></p>



<p><em>And find deliverance in my pleas</em></p>



<p><em>Of repentance</em></p>



<p>The grace of God is a place where we recognize that we really need Him. As we come into this new year, we need to offer and present an attitude of gratitude. Although we are sinners and have experienced shortcomings last year in 2020, we must ask for forgiveness and start anew. Our spiritual refreshing actually comes from God and God alone. Therefore, we grow, develop, and blossom into a much better son, daughter, and follower of the Heavenly Father. His whole intention is to bless us with love. With the new year now in session, we must show our actions and duties even greater for God’s Kingdom. James 4:8 states:</p>



<p>“Come near to God and He will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.”</p>



<p>At the end of the day, God wants us to have a celebration with Him and to show the world that He is a real, everlasting God. The more that we open up to Him, the more that He wants to pour out His blessings onto us. His love covers a multitude of sins. And what is greater and more powerful than God’s love? Nothing. We cannot have a relationship of loving God if we do not show it. </p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>“Let the peace of Christ rule your hearts, since as members of one body, you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.”</em> </p>



<p><strong>– Colossians 3: 15-17</strong></p>



<p>God is always in control and knows what is best for His children. While 2020 was a year filled with ups-and-downs and challenges, it was also a year that had God’s blessings. And the same will occur for this new year in 2021. The past year can be seen as a reflection of ourselves and what we can do to make the new year an even better one. In doing so, we should first start the year by giving thanks to God. Even showing appreciation for the littlest of things, it is still God who provided us that first breath of life and the endless opportunities for us to experience and thrive on. Second, we should also show more care and love towards those who are around us. If somebody seems to be in distress or is saddened about something, do not be afraid to cheer them up with God’s Word, for His Word is devotional wisdom that will guide us through anything. </p>

<p><span class=""has-inline-color has-black-color"">On December 21 and 22 of 2020, the AUHS School of Pharmacy supported and collaborated with College Medical Center (CMC) of Long Beach for administering the Pfizer-BioN-Tech COVID vaccine to their front-line workers and other CMC personnel. During those two days, the vaccine team, which consisted of nurses, pharmacists, and pharmacy students, administered over 125 vaccinations. Among the pharmacy students were AUHS’ very own Joshua Haywood (c/o 2022), Leena Mazumdar (c/o 2022), and Leelit Minasyan (c/o 2022). With the School of Pharmacy faculty supervising and monitoring their practice, the students were able to receive first-hand experience in providing vaccine services. The ongoing global pandemic has generated many challenges for everyone. However, with the recent distribution and implementation of the vaccine, there is steady progress. The AUHS School of Pharmacy faculty and students feel very honored and proud to represent their profession and to provide some of the first vaccinations against the coronavirus.</span></p>

<p><em>I wanted to wield the future</em> </p>



<p><em>To see, what was in store</em></p>



<p><em>Peek into my tomorrows</em></p>



<p><em>Though the image, not quite sure</em></p>



<p><em>I thought I saw the picture</em></p>



<p><em>Of what it means to soar</em></p>



<p><em>I rode upon the jet stream</em></p>



<p><em>To glance at it once more</em></p>



<p><em>I knew it would require</em></p>



<p><em>Freeing wrongs I’d done before</em></p>



<p><em>To take His cross upon me</em></p>



<p><em>Because my Liege has to me swore, a new</em></p>



<p>2020 has gone by in the blink of an eye. With 2021 now here, it is time to start anew. A refreshing new start is an ideal time to reflect on our wrongdoings and to begin strengthening our relationship with God. We must be vigilant and bring what is deemed as good in His eyes for the new year. We may have experienced many challenges and struggles last year, but God will gift us with the utmost abundance for 2021. Therefore, we must be prepared to give more and to offer more. God, in His righteousness, wants to bless us. Revelation 21:4 states:</p>



<p>“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. He who was seated on the throne said, ‘I am making everything new!'”</p>



<p>If we are continuing to do the same thing we did last year, we are not making any improvements. Instead, we are peddling backwards. As sons and daughters of God, we should not focus on the outside distractions that will stray us away from Him. Our primary focus and main priority is to think about and prepare for what we should do to carry out God’s work by a ten-fold. There is great gain in hearing His Word and reciting His Word. Be <strong>bold</strong> and <strong>courageous</strong> for what you will do this year. </p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Appreciate the times you have</em> </p>



<p><em>Don’t think them less or small</em></p>



<p><em>For therein lies the sweetest draught</em></p>



<p><em>Most precious drink of all</em></p>



<p><em>So, cherish and please regard the lot</em></p>



<p><em>Adventures that accrue</em> </p>



<p><em>Worthy of appreciation are</em></p>



<p><em>These times God made for you</em></p>



<p>When we reach the point of familiarity, we lose the act of appreciation even for the smallest of things. It is not something that we should neglect or ignore. To show appreciation for God and to show appreciation for others are two aspects that should not be separated. When we consider that time is a blessing from God, we need to appreciate that time and not take it for granted. In result, we must make the best of it. Appreciation starts by being thankful to God. It is a priceless act out of emotion. If we do not appreciate the “little,” then we are not being thankful for what God has done for us. 1 Thessalonians 5:11 states:</p>



<p>“Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you are already doing. But we ask you, brothers, to <strong>acknowledge those who work diligently</strong> among you, who preside over you in the Lord and give you instruction. In love, hold them in highest regard because of their work. Live in peace with one another.”</p>



<p>In the presence of God, you have power. In the absence of God, you are powerless. In His presence, all things are possible and doable. He has already given us victory with ties to appreciation. We can become so accustomed and so familiar with things that are handed to us, that we often take it for granted and forget to thank God. What we have is the moment when we must show our appreciation and gratitude now and henceforth. </p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I haven’t seen past tomorrow</em></p>



<p><em>To where what’s next might be</em></p>



<p><em>Nor can I gaze at the yonder</em></p>



<p><em>Or hold captive, my destiny</em></p>



<p><em>But what I have as perception</em></p>



<p><em>Says to me each day</em></p>



<p><em>Guard well every moment of living</em></p>



<p><em>With God and your loves in “The Way”</em></p>



<p>The only permanent thing that is set in stone is God’s everlasting and unconditional love for us. Tomorrow can never be certain or for sure. No matter what plans we make and how much we make them, there are times when things do not go according to plan. God gifts us with many wonderful things such as a family, a circle of friends, and the opportunity to live our lives everyday. In fact, our lives are so precious and eternity with God is among us. We do not have ultimate control on what happens to us. It is not guaranteed that what we think will occur is <em>actually</em> going to occur. James 4:13 states:</p>



<p>“Come now, who you say, ‘Today or tomorrow, we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit’ – yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.'”</p>



<p>Love requires excellence. If you love God, then you must love others around you, and vice-versa. The tragic events that happen in our lives are a subject to us waking up and realizing that we have lost the opportunity. Time is very important, precious, and priceless.  It is of the essence that God provides for us, but can go away quickly in a heartbeat. We cannot chase down time that has been lost. Therefore, it is important to grab it and cherish it. Today is a reality, and tomorrow is a fantasy.</p>

<p>To obtain joy, it should be acquired from the outside, but from within. This holiday season is an ideal time for joy, but it should not solely be the reason why we spread joy to others around us. God’s excellency is what we must proclaim and publicize so that His name and Word are known. In fact, as His most precious sons and daughters, we have to be excellent in everything we do in the light of His presence. What God creates and provides for us is ascribed in His handiwork. Philippians 4:8 states:</p>



<p>“Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything, worthy of praise, dwell on these things.”</p>



<p>We don’t have a choice but to become better for God. To do the work heartily for the Lord shows our excellence and devotion to Him. We are all responsible for the things and tasks that God has assigned for us to do. Similarly to how a teacher instructs a student, it is a reflection of what God is instructing us to do. So, ask yourself in His name: Have we done our very best? And have we given our very best? </p>

<p>Dr. Albert Ngo, Assistant Professor of Pharmaceutical Science at the AUHS School of Pharmacy, received acceptance of his research manuscript titled, “Prevalence of Hypertension in Homeless Adults: an Interprofessional Education Community-Based Health Fairs Cross-Sectional Study in Urban Long Beach, California,” for publication. Professor Massimo Volpe, Editor-in-Chief at Elsevier, informed Dr. Ngo about his recent achievement. Dr. Ngo’s manuscript will be published in the journal <em>High Blood Pressure &amp; Cardiovascular Prevention</em>.</p>



<p><em><strong>How would you apply this achievement to influence others?</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Ngo</strong>: I believe that publishing a research article is part of my duties here at the American University of Health Sciences. I am trying my best to fulfill my job duties. This publication is a result of a team of co-authors. I believe that as faculty members, we need to know our strengths, weaknesses and set a clear goal every year. For instance, I am very productive when I am part of a team. I also believe that we need to encourage teamwork and collaboration among faculty and especially, set a collaborative research goal. That will ultimately help all faculty become productive in doing research and getting extra mural finding.</p>



<p><em><strong>What are your greatest career achievements during your time with AUHS?</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Ngo</strong>: I have two publications since I joined the American University of Health Sciences. But, I believe I can do more in securing an extra mural funding. I am diligently working on that.</p>



<p><em><strong>What active assignments or projects are you currently involved in?</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Ngo</strong>: I am heavily involved with the AUHS foundation. We are trying our best to empower the homeless community through health education and reduction of health disparities. I also have a joint appointment with Charles Drew University via the memorandum of understanding between AUHS and CDU. I am part of the drug discovery unit team at CDU.</p>



<p><em><strong>Tell us about a mentor and/or influential figure in your life who has created an impact on you or inspired you to set on your own path today.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Ngo</strong>: Since I started my Ph.D. program at the University of Missouri, Kansas City (UMKC), I made a vow to myself to embrace a career of research and academia. Since then, I began to develop the skills and acquire the required experience during my years at UMKC. There is a very influential researcher in the field of pharmaceutical science who has been successful. He is an eminent professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His name is Pr. Robert Samuel Langer. We are both chemical engineers and he has been successful in the field of pharmaceutical science. I am trying to follow in his footsteps. So far, I have two U.S. patents from my previous work at UMKC. My dream is to become successful like him.</p>



<p><em><strong>What difference has AUHS made during your affiliation with them?</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Ngo</strong>: AUHS is a particularly good place to work.&nbsp; I already learned a lot here at AUHS, especially the U.S. Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education process. I have also strengthened my research and teaching skills. I have gained a lot of experience that will make me a successful faculty member.</p>



<p><strong><em>Finally, as an educator and faculty member, what advice do you have for prospective and current students? What do you hope to see for AUHS and its community?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Dr. Ngo</strong>: As an educator, I will advise prospective students to join us. AUHS is a truly diverse and inclusive workplace with highly qualified faculty and staff. All students from different backgrounds and cultures are welcome here. Student success is our number one priority. Faculty and staff will help them to get the education, experience, and skills needed to become a successful future healthcare worker.</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences, with the Southern California Chapter of the ACRP, held an end-of-the-year virtual event to inform and educate healthcare professionals about COVID-19 and the effects that it has on clinical and non-clinical studies. This is the university’s second collaboration and partnership with the chapter this year. The event, titled “COVID-19 &amp; The Effect on Clinical/Non-Clinical Studies”, was held on December 9, 2020 and was a two-hour virtual event that discussed about FDA guidelines and protocols to take during the ongoing pandemic, such as re-envisioning clinical trials, how to ensure participant safety, and increasing feasibility of clinical and non-clinical studies in times of crisis. Mr. Eric Pittman, the current Program Division Director for the FDA/ORA Bioresearch Monitoring Program Division II (BIMO-W), was once again the guest speaker for this event as highlights and points of discussion were informed during his presentation. AUHS, along with the Southern California Chapter of the ACRP, firmly believes that providing and educating about the proper steps and measures to take regarding clinical and non-clinical studies are imperative within FDA and healthcare regulations. The university is proud of hosting this event and many more upcoming quarterly events regarding the FDA.</p>

<p><em>I have felt the prick of thorns, upon my feet</em></p>



<p><em>As I walked about dressed, attired so neat</em></p>



<p><em>Have experienced a pain that seemed to stay</em></p>



<p>‘<em>Til I stopped, looked, and began to pray, to my God</em></p>



<p>Through life, there are ups-and-downs that an individual encounters and experiences. The thorns that are poking and causing us pain are a distraction that is slowly wearing us down. There is no victory without an enemy. Ironically, it is through the enemy or challenges that make us even stronger and braver than before. Those thorns that keep poking and prodding us, while they may wear us down, may also stimulate and motivate us to get back up on our feet. With God by our side, there is no doubt that we will defeat and overcome the enemy with His grace. What doesn’t change is the fact that during the passing of challenges, we only become stronger and mightier than ever. 2 Corinthians 12:7 states:</p>



<p>“To keep me from becoming conceited because of the exceptional nature of these revelations. a thorn was given to me and placed in my body. It was Satan’s messenger to keep on tormenting me so that I would not become conceited. I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me, but he has told me, ‘My grace is all you need, because my power is perfected in weakness.’ Therefore, I will most happily boast about my weaknesses, so that the Messiah’s power may rest on me.”</p>



<p>The triumph that we have with God trumps over everything. As flawed human beings, we are subjected and vulnerable to many dangerous risks. In fact, we are actually powerless without God. If we do not have enemies to face, then we do not know how to stand up and fight against them. God has equipped us with all the talent and glory to show the enemy that we can overpower them no matter what.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>What we need of is often waiting.</em></p>



<p><em>Simply waiting for us to come.</em></p>



<p><em>It rests beside your destination.</em></p>



<p><em>Tied there by The Son.</em></p>



<p>We frequently don’t know or cherish what we actually have until we lose it. Every answer that we need or a solution that we often seek out is already manifested in the things that may not seem logical or sensible. Everything that we want to acquire is already tied up and saved in God’s protective hands. What God has promised for us has already been planned out and tied up for us, even before we were conceived and born. He is just waiting for us to go out and receive it. Walking on the path of righteousness is not an easy journey. There will be hurdles and distractions along the way because Satan is consistently spewing out waves of temptations at us. In fact, Satan’s only objective is to watch us fall down and fail numerous times. However, if you believe in God, then you must believe in the impossible. Luke 19:30 states:</p>



<p>“Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.”</p>



<p>Struggles are always overcome with the grace of God because He is there watching us all the time with good intentions. His guidance has a strong presence that surrounds and protects us during our walks and strolls in life.</p>

<p>The Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT (ˈem-ˌkat) [1], is a standardized examination for prospective medical students in the United States as well as a few other countries such as Australia, Canada, and the Caribbean Islands. It is designed and created to help the admissions offices of medical schools to assess medical school applicants’ knowledge of natural, behavioral, and social science concepts and principles. It also assesses their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Currently, the MCAT is administered by the Association of American Medical College, or AAMC.</p>



<p>MCAT is a 7.5-hour (including a break) closed-book examination with four 90-95 min. sections, each of which contains 50-60 multiple choice questions:</p>



<p>(1) Chemical and physical foundations of biological systems.</p>



<p>(2) Critical analysis and reasoning skills (CARS).</p>



<p>(3) Biological and biochemical foundations of living systems.</p>



<p>(4) Psychological, social, and biological foundations of behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of these four sections is scored from a low of 118 to a high of 132, with a midpoint of 125 and the sum of the four section scores ranges from 472 to 528, with a midpoint of 500. Significant positive relationships between MCAT composite scores and USMLE (U.S. Medical Licensure Exam, Steps 1 and 2) exam scores have been indicated in the literature [2]. With its predictive value on the USMLA scores, the MCAT has been used as an objective measure for admissions decision-making by medical school officials.</p>

<p><em>There are times when we will struggle</em></p>



<p><em>Have burdens placed right there</em></p>



<p><em>When what is before us seems impossible</em></p>



<p><em>At least for us to bear</em></p>



<p><em>‘Til we remember that we are The Chosen</em></p>



<p><em>All stewards with a gift</em></p>



<p><em>From God, His Son and Spirit</em></p>



<p><em>Who was and forever is with, us</em></p>



<p>We are chosen, elected, and selected to be chosen by God. Our assignments that God gives us are actually more significant than we think it is. God’s promises are what keeps us in check with ourselves and our faith. Without Him, it’s a layer of vanity upon vanity. God is a God of Order; thus, He is an Order of Excellency. When we finally carry out and accomplish the assignments that He bestows onto us, that is when God will be able to say, “A job well done.” Joshua 1:9 states:</p>



<p>“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”</p>



<p>Therefore, it is a daily reminder that God possesses the utmost control and power over what we do. When things seem hectic and in disarray, we have to put our entire faith and trust in God for everything. He will not allow anything to come up against us without His permission and doing. In addition, He is with us at ALL times because He is guarding and holding us. If God allows any form of permission, it is in His hands: “I Am That I Am.” So, remember to be strong and take courage as a warrior of God. Do not panic before difficulties and blessed be to those who still believe, but cannot see.</p>

<p><em>You need only do your best</em></p>



<p><em>Let God show you His glory</em></p>



<p><em>In His arms now you can rest</em></p>



<p>God is letting you know that no matter how difficult situations may be, He is always there to help you through the good times and the bad. To win or lose something is a subjective matter. A loss can be another person’s gain. However, we should do the things that God puts us through because He will protect and love us unconditionally. Our battle through these challenges are also God’s challenges to help us through. Exodus 14:12 states:</p>



<p>“Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.’ But Moses told the people, ‘Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the Lord’s salvation, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.'”</p>



<p>So, take heed and keep God with you at all times. You do not have to go through battles, trials, and tribulations alone because He will be right there with you to fight through them. </p>

<p><em>A mystery of such great renown</em></p>



<p><em>For in our sins, forgiveness found</em></p>



<p><em>In our faults, deliverance</em></p>



<p><em>Above our wrongs, His blood was spent. </em></p>



<p><em>The Sacrament.</em></p>



<p>Every morning, day, night, and passing minute, God graces us with His blessings. There is an opportunity to do more today and for the many things to come onward. God covets us from ourselves and from our iniquities. He is amazing in His forbearance for us. In fact, God is the ideal definition of unconditional, steadfast love and His love for us knows no boundaries. Isaiah 43:24 states:</p>



<p>“You have not bought me sweet cane with your silver, nor satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities. I, yes, I am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake and remembers your sins no more.”</p>



<p>God is indeed a divine mystery, but He is a God who is full of amazement and wonder. When things do come about, it is His way for us to show appreciation and to forgive ourselves. </p>

<p><em>What indeed are these trials that come</em></p>



<p><em>Are they not here to shape each one,</em></p>



<p><em>Of us, to do great works and deeds</em></p>



<p><em>Glorify our Lord, as we succeed</em></p>



<p>We must rejoice with the glory that God has given us. If we do not experience trials and tribulations, we are not going to gain spiritual “muscles,” which equates to spiritual strength. It is through trials and tribulations in life that make us stronger and humbler. When we have those moments when we feel boxed in and trapped inside, God is the only source who can release us and relieve us from the pain and suffering. While our initial instinct is to seek man for guidance and help, it should only be God whom we need to seek instead. 2 Corinthians 4: 8-11 states:</p>



<p>“We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair. We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed. Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies. Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies.”</p>



<p>Although there are times of trouble, we will not be crushed. We have to know God to have Him lift us up and make us stronger than before. In fact, it does not matter how many challenges we have or endure. What matters more is how much one has faith in God, especially during times of difficulty. We cannot have triumph without trials and tribulations but most importantly, we cannot have triumph without God.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I cannot explain how it is</em></p>



<p><em>When all along, I fail as His</em></p>



<p><em>To honor, fully keep His words</em></p>



<p><em>And yet He blesses me amidst the purge, enlarged</em></p>



<p>There are no boundaries and limits to what God can do for us. He is keeping us through this time in the midst of everything that is going on. When many things seem to go wrong, God is faithful in everything that He is going to do for us. In result, we should give more, honor more, and show more to God. There is no dream or promise that He won’t provide and gift to us. He will give you the desires of His heart and more. If God is with you, who can be against you? Genesis 13:16 states:</p>



<p>“I will make your offspring like the dust of the Earth, so that if one could count the dust of the Earth, then your offspring could be counted. Get up and walk around the land, through its length and breadth, for I will give it to you.”</p>



<p>We have to always remember to ask God in everything that we do. In fact, we tend to measure our relationships with God based on our capacity, time, and willingness for Him. This should not be a habitual approach to developing and solidifying our relationship with God. When He enlarges you, it is not for you but for Him. As a child of God, you are destined to carry on His Word and make Him larger than life. We cannot stay in the same place when we are doing more for God. Remember God in everything that He does for you so therefore, enlarge and expand your heart in the name of His Kingdom.</p>

<p><em>How do we show thankfulness?</em></p>



<p><em>For all that God has done</em></p>



<p><em>Is it not by acts of sharing?</em></p>



<p><em>In obedience to His son</em></p>



<p><em>When we consider our lives</em></p>



<p><em>The places and times we went</em></p>



<p><em>We can only be much humbler</em></p>



<p><em>Knowing God, His Son was sent</em></p>



<p>This upcoming Thanksgiving holiday should be a time of major thanks, humility, and reflection. But, the holiday should be not a valid excuse to show unconditional gratitude. Instead, everyday should be a day of thanks to God. The things that God has given us cannot be taken for granted. He has already and still is doing great things for us. If He is doing more for you, we need to do so much more in return. We need to be cognizant of all these blessings for a reason: God’s blessings are what pushes us forward. Matthew 25:40 states:</p>



<p>“And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.'”</p>



<p>Have an attitude of gratitude. We only have this chance henceforth to come forward to God and say, “Thank you, Dad.” Our praise should be elevated. Why is it that God has chosen us for deliverance and to carry out His good deeds and works? We are the most flawed sinners as we know but yet, God still gifts us His blessings. He wants us to remember where we came from. Anything that we offer to God, we also have to be God-giving to others. We have every reason to be thankful for His mercy and love.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p>The AUHS School of Nursing has recently earned a Top Spot in the 2021 Ranking List of Top Nursing Schools, as stated by Nursing Degree Search. In addition, several different awards have been granted to AUHS in this year’s ranking analysis, including:</p>



<ul><li>13th in Best Nursing Bachelor’s Degree Schools in the Far Western U.S. Region</li><li>13th in Best Nursing Schools in California</li></ul>



<p>Carly Stockwell, a representative from Nursing Degree Search, shared the good news with Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the Vice President, Provost, and Chief Nurse Administrator at AUHS. The School of Nursing offers Bachelor and Master of Science Programs in Nursing, along with a Post-Master’s Family Nurse Practitioner Certificate Program which is designed for registered nurses who already hold a Master’s Degree. Each program offers a structured curriculum that is Christ-centered upon clinical reasoning, evidence-based practice, and interprofessional communication. Since its founding, the AUHS School of Nursing has paved the way for providing minority students with the opportunity to start their careers in healthcare.</p>

<p><em>There is so much noise</em></p>



<p><em>Distractions each day</em></p>



<p><em>Things we must do</em></p>



<p><em>That get in our way</em></p>



<p><em>Stopping us from hearing</em></p>



<p><em>Let alone to enjoy</em></p>



<p><em>Preventing us from sitting</em></p>



<p><em>Like girls and like boys, before Dad</em></p>



<p>With the ongoing pandemic, it has been extremely difficult for everyone around the world to reach out to their loved ones. Division has impacted society as we know it and in result, we are coming apart. In times of frustration and trouble that affect us negatively, we have to turn to God in order to seek guidance. We must also make ourselves aware that God will always be with us, no matter how difficult the situation can get. Now is the time to double-bound and really put your faith onto Him. Your belief can wane away if He is not a priority. All of us need to be a part of God so that we can accomplish things with God. In all things, we have victory if God is with us. Mark 6:31 states:</p>



<p>“And He said to them, ‘Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.’ For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. So, they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place.”</p>



<p>Important moments with God include quiet, personal times with Him. During those quiet times, allow God to hear you loud and clear. God pushes and crushes us with good intentions, so that we can develop and improve ourselves to become better people. Remember to have time to connect with God because at the end of the day, it is our own personal fate and relationship with Him that determines our realization. Glorify God to the fullest.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I seem to be not always thankful</em></p>



<p><em>For the wonderful gifts you gave</em></p>



<p><em>The freedom to pray and worship</em></p>



<p><em>Or the fact that I’ve been saved</em></p>



<p><em>Neither am I grateful</em></p>



<p><em>To be in such a place</em></p>



<p><em>When I’m reminded of your goodness</em></p>



<p><em>To appreciate your grace</em></p>



<p><em>So, help me to remember</em></p>



<p><em>Help me to cherish too</em></p>



<p><em>The perfect and endless blessings</em></p>



<p><em>Your love for me makes true</em></p>



<p>How blessed are we to have the opportunity to praise and worship God? We spend so much time doing other tasks rather than spending time with God. In fact, we take people for granted, our jobs for granted, and even God for granted at times. If we want to see an increase of goodness, we must express our gratitude and thanks to God. When we wake up every morning and go on about our day, we have to cherish the passing times with God. Even when we get distracted and off-track, God still blesses us despite how ungrateful and unappreciative we are and can be. A lot of times, we do not even appreciate the power of prayer and instead, underestimate it. Therefore, be truly humbled by the power of God. Being thankful is being thankful for everything that He has given us. Romans 1:21 states:</p>



<p>“For although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.”</p>



<p>We have the utmost freedom to worship God but unfortunately, we take it for granted. God wants us to interact with Him, to have a meaningful and heart-to-heart conversation with Him, to reason with Him, to listen to Him, and much more. So, let this be a firm reminder to always keep God in your hearts and minds.</p>

<p>AUHS held its 2nd IPE Workshop on November 13, 2020. The IPE, or Interprofessional Education, Workshop requires students to work and engage in interprofessional groups through a case-based learning scenario. Activities during the session included tasks such as watching informational videos, reviewing case notes, and contributing to online discussions. The workshop, which was held virtually through ZOOM, ran from 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM and consisted of breakout sessions and group discussions. Facilitators of the workshop comprised of AUHS faculty, who assessed and monitored contributions in each assigned activity and provided necessary feedback. Students in interprofessional groups then discussed the importance of working and communicating together effectively to provide quality care and ensure patient safety. </p>



<p>Interprofessional education workshops are a great method for students to experience working and learning from each other, clarifying roles, negating negative perception about others, and understanding that teamwork and effort are important when it comes to patient care. In doing so, this will allow understanding the capability and limitations to effectively become a key team player in the field of healthcare. At AUHS, students from the School of Nursing (Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing), School of Pharmacy (Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Doctor of Pharmacy, Pharmacy Technician), and School of Clinical Research (Master of Science in Clinical Research), are given this blessed opportunity from God to develop and strengthen their interprofessional and interpersonal skills.</p>

<p><em>How do we become better</em> </p>



<p><em>Fitter, leaner, for the day</em></p>



<p><em>Casting aside our burdens</em></p>



<p><em>Sins that stress and weigh</em></p>



<p><em>How do we become lighter</em></p>



<p><em>Freer, nimbler, to endure</em></p>



<p><em>Perhaps in our reaffirmation</em></p>



<p><em>That His love for us, Is sure.</em></p>



<p>Everyday that God is with us is the opportunity to make things better. There is always room for improvement within us and towards others. In fact, God will create situations for us to make things happen for our benefit. We cannot prevent ourselves from sinning, because only God can do that. Despite our attempts to try our best, we are always flawed and imperfect. God is not asking us to be perfect, but He wants us to wake up and get our act together. In losing everything, we gain everything from God. We become better because God allows things to bless us more. In doing so, we are better sons and daughters of God now. Daniel 5:20 states:</p>



<p>“But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit was hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken from him. He was driven away from mankind, and his mind was like that of a beast. He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind, setting over it whom He wishes.”</p>



<p>We may think that we have the power to make ourselves better. But, it is only through God who provides His power to make us better. If we put God in the center of our universe, our anointing and strength will be renewed. God is still permitting us to improve today and through our end days. Lose yourself in God to gain new life.</p>

<p><em>I do not have the luxury</em></p>



<p><em>Of waiting ’til it’s done</em></p>



<p><em>Stopping at the crossroads</em></p>



<p><em>When life is on the run</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot afford to rest ’til</em></p>



<p><em>At least have tried my best</em></p>



<p><em>To win this race for my God</em></p>



<p><em>For my love and all the rest</em></p>



<p><em>For those who have stopped looking</em></p>



<p><em>Those who have lost their way</em></p>



<p><em>Those who are still soaked in</em></p>



<p><em>The bloody price we pay</em></p>



<p><em>So, let me not act rudely</em></p>



<p><em>But I realize how short this time</em></p>



<p><em>I must be about the business</em></p>



<p><em>Of my Father, that’s divine</em></p>



<p>Yesterday is already gone, but tomorrow brings another opportunity. That is why we should make the best of today and act promptly. We only have this moment and today to show our appreciation and gratitude. We also cannot stop what is planned, for we must appreciates life’s values and wonders. Time passes away and God gives us so much opportunity. Therefore, it is our duty to not take today, tomorrow, and rest of the future for granted. Now is the time to do the right and proper thing. What is there for us to share today so that we can make today and tomorrow better? Matthew 6:34 states:</p>



<p>“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”</p>



<p>While we have the capability to work today, with God, we must perpetuate with what He wants us to do. God has given us sufficiency with him. Everything that we have and need in our lives is all provided by God. We ask God for everything, yet we still end up being unappreciative because we are always looking for more. We are so ungrateful for today because we are so focused on tomorrow. Work hard to play hard. Work hard to fulfill your days and moments, and play hard to please God. Our journey is not complete until God decides that it is done.</p>

 God’s Promises,https://news.auhs.edu/gods-promises/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gods-Promises-600x403.jpg,Morning Dew,"
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large is-resized""><img loading=""lazy"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gods-Promises.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-18180"" width=""442"" height=""324"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gods-Promises.jpg 910w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gods-Promises-300x220.jpg 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gods-Promises-768x564.jpg 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px""></figure>



<p><em>While the world might say it promises</em></p>



<p><em>And may even give their word</em></p>



<p><em>Be mindful that they’re human</em></p>



<p><em>May not remember what you heard</em></p>



<p><em>But everything God promises</em></p>



<p><em>Each one of them is true</em></p>



<p><em>You can depend and even act upon</em></p>



<p><em>What His word has Promised you</em></p>



<p>How many times have we been let down by others who have made promises but in the end, broke them? And vice-versa? It is certainly not a good feeling. The things that we do, we tend to forget to fulfill those promises to other people but most importantly, we forget to fulfill those promises to God. Despite these inopportune acts, God’s promises are always set in stone. His promises are always a “Yes” and an “Amen!” We cannot be good enough to deserve God’s love. Yet, He still blesses us because our connections with Him are eternal. At the end of the day, He promises us peace and opportunity. Even when we break our promises with God and God keeps His promises with us, it is in that moment when we have to acknowledge and appreciate the unconditional consideration and love that He gives us. Isaiah 40: 31 states:</p>



<p>“But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not be faint.”</p>



<p>Therefore, it is important to listen to God’s instructions. We have to believe in God’s promise because He will restore and reward us. In fact, His promises are a reward. We should not question God’s ability to give that to us. In times of need, when we are in trouble, that is usually the time when we ask for God’s promise. This is not the appropriate approach to take. We should not need to seek God when we are at our most vulnerable. God has to keep His word, which is why His promises are very important.</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences, in partnership with College Medical Center of Long Beach, organized and hosted the 5<sup>th</sup> Annual Behavioral Health &amp; Post-Acute Care Symposium on October 29, 2020. The symposium focused on behavioral and mental health, which are ongoing topics of discussion within society today. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), 1 in 5 Americans are affected by mental health conditions. In result, millions of Americans face the reality of living with a mental illness each year. The aspects of stigma and rejection are toxic to one’s mental health because it creates an environment of fear, shame and silence that prevents many people from seeking professional help and treatment. Overall, the perception of mental illness will not change unless there is proper, actual change and progress. To raise awareness and to further educate the public, the symposium was held virtually through ZOOM on the AUHS campus while implementing COVID-19 regulations and social distancing guidelines. Joe Avelino, the Chief Executive Officer of College Medical Center, and his team of leadership met with leadership at AUHS in collaboration to provide support, educate the public, fight against stigma, and advocate for policies that uplift those with mental illness along with their families and loved ones. “It’s a great honor to partner up with American University of Health Sciences so that the public can become aware about issues regarding behavioral and mental health. It is an important and ongoing concern that must be discussed in further detail,” stated Mr. Avelino.</p>



<p>The event, which was held from 9:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M., introduced 11 guest speakers from the healthcare industry, legal firms, and various organizations. Faculty, students, and staff from the Schools of Nursing (Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing), Pharmacy (Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Doctor of Pharmacy, Pharmacy Technician), and Clinical Research (Master of Science in Clinical Research), were also among those who attended the event. Breakout sessions were included in the scheduled program agenda so that attendees can participate by listening and engaging in a Q &amp; A panel afterwards. It is truly a blessing from God by which AUHS extends their warmest gratitude and thanks to College Medical Center of Long Beach to gather as one so that they can both become centers for outreach regarding behavioral and mental health. </p>

<p><em>I often see imperfection</em></p>



<p><em>In so many things I do</em></p>



<p><em>Except where you are present</em></p>



<p><em>To pare, make fruit come through</em></p>



<p>None of us are perfect. We cannot be perfect like God, but we have to fulfill our imperfections by seeking God and asking for His guidance. All of us are continuing to grow and change, but the process of pruning teaches us to become more prosperous and better than before. Pruning away the bad habits teaches us to take away those bad habits. This is similar to abandoning a garden. When a garden is abandoned and neglected, the garden will continue to grow and eventually get out of control. There is no one to supervise it or keep it in check. A lack of pruning will trigger the garden to grow whichever way it pleases with no guidance. This is reflective to how God keeps His eyes on us, His children. When God chases us down to keep us in check, it is an act of disciplinary love. Like any parent, God wants us to go in the right direction. Proverbs 3:11 states:</p>



<p>“My son, do not reject the discipline of the Lord, and do not loathe His rebuke; for the Lord disciplines the one He loves, as does a father the son in whom he delights.”</p>



<p>If God does not chase you down, you are not seen as one of His children. Be chastened with God so that you can grow with Him. When we become spiritually pruned, it is an act of correction, chastening, and love. In order for us to develop and improve ourselves into better people, allow God to make those changes unto you. If you produce fruit after being pruned, multiply it even further by having God continue to prune you along the way. While pruning may sound like a pleasant term, the process is painful and challenging. Sometimes, we do not want change but change can be a very good thing in God’s eyes.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Who shall grant to me respite this day</em></p>



<p><em>Or sit before my Lord and hear Him say</em></p>



<p><em>What wondrous adventures are in store</em></p>



<p><em>For we His children, lass and boy</em></p>



<p>There is an overwhelming feeling when you are being loved by your children and they love you back. A child’s love is very innocent and pure because it is unconditional. As children of God, it is important for us to reciprocate that unconditional love back towards God. For future parents, their children must be raised in the presence of God. In fact, we tend to be nonchalant, passive, and unaffected when we are surrounded by those we are familiar with. However, we have to take into account that we should cherish the moments being shared with our loved ones and with others. It is never really certain when our time and when our loved one’s time is near. Matthew 19:14 states:</p>



<p>“Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these.'”</p>



<p>Spread happiness and kindness to others, as you will never know when their time or even your time will happen. With everything that has been recently occurring in the world due to COVID-19, our lives have been adjusted and changed. While change may be difficult in the beginning, God definitely has plans to make the situation better. If you have not kept in contact with a certain someone for a while, reach out to them and let them know that they are still in your prayers and thoughts, and that you still love them.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I was looking for a place where</em></p>



<p><em>I could come to know</em></p>



<p><em>Be led there by Your Spirit</em></p>



<p><em>In the process, I might grow</em></p>



<p><em>Discover what’s the meaning</em></p>



<p><em>Of loving just like You</em></p>



<p><em>And with the help of holiness</em></p>



<p><em>Your Ways, I would pursue</em></p>



<p>While words physically come out of our mouths, the content and meaning genuinely derives from our hearts. A pure heart means that an individual wants to strive for things because he or she truly wants to. So, what exactly is a “pure heart”? Well, for one, a “pure heart” is something that everyone has difficulty developing and staying true to. With so many iniquities and sin in this world, we are enveloped in this wave of evil and temptation. In result, our heart must be guarded and protected from the things that cause harm to us because we are so damaged and vulnerable. Psalms 25:4 states:</p>



<p>“Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths. <strong>Guide</strong> me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You.”</p>



<p>It is not how much success we gain when we begin, but how we end. God gives us mercy because He shows His compassion and love for us. Therefore, what is the main factor that leads to corruption? The reason is association. Surround yourself with godly people who will uplift you and make you into a better, stronger individual. Ask yourself how you want to be remembered and what legacy you will leave behind. Success is about the the peace, joy, and love that you will experience in your life.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>I was angry for a moment</em></p>



<p><em>Was offended and hurt, you see</em></p>



<p><em>But, I thought of Jesus</em></p>



<p><em>And all He’s done for me</em></p>



<p>What we say is the possibility of becoming a reality, some way or another. The statements that we declare can stem from our emotions and thoughts. Human beings are indeed impulsive by nature. We have a tendency to say our thoughts out loud before thinking what the actual context is about. There is a popular saying that states, “Do not add fuel to the fire.” In result, we must be mindful of what we are saying to others. Complaining and talking about others behind their backs adds to that fire and causes it to become larger. As Christians, we are supposed to be putting out those fires. A great leader surrounds oneself with greater and godly people who will uplift that leader to become better. Colossians 4:6 states:</p>



<p>“Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.”</p>



<p>Talking ill about someone else breaks down the Spirit. The Spirit is actually a gentle aspect of God so when there is ill-will towards another individual, there is disrespect and offense towards the Spirit. We emerge into someone different due to from what is dwelling within us. In other words, our emotions bring out another side or character of ourselves that are reflected as negative. All in all, be mindful of what you say wherever you are. Make the other person better, not bitter.</p>

<p><em>I found, I had missed something</em></p>

<p><em>I realized that I was missing</em></p>



<p><em>That greater part of you</em></p>



<p><strong><em>MERCY</em></strong></p>



<p>We must allow ourselves to be forgiven and to let God’s mercy into our lives. Oftentimes, we focus so much on other people’s wrongdoings that we do not want to forgive those who have let us down. Mercy is not something that we should lose along the way. God is so merciful that He sent His Son Jesus Christ to die for our sins. He is very forgiving but the unfortunate part is that we are so ignorant of God’s blessings for us, to the point where we take it for granted and brush it off. The reality is that people need God and to fully recognize Him. As God’s chosen, we must do something to help others. Luke 6:36 states:</p>



<p>“Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.”</p>



<p>We are guilty of our own wrongdoings and in result, punishment is a common outlook. We repent for our sins and because we do so, God is very forgiving and merciful. Mercy leaves a trail that needs to be followed by us and others. It is a sweet aroma that cannot be missed. As much as it feels good to be forgiven by others, it feels even more enlightening to be forgiven by God. Allow Him in your heart to show you how to forgive others and develop yourself into a better follower of God. What God cherishes and values is mercy.</p>

<p><em>I looked at hairs upon my head</em></p>



<p><em>The grey and white ones stood out instead</em></p>



<p><em>Of laying down in obedience to</em></p>



<p><em>While the young do what I tell them to do</em></p>



<p><em>I realized then ’twas not in vain</em></p>



<p><em>The passage of time and that wisdom gained</em></p>



<p><em>The knowledge that only time can teach</em></p>



<p><em>Carrying us far beyond our reach</em></p>



<p><em>A truth My Father revealed to me</em></p>



<p><em>Through all the trails He had me see</em></p>



<p><em>It is never too far in faith to wait</em></p>



<p><em>With God, it’s not too late</em></p>



<p>The things that God blesses us with is a reminder that He exists and that time is never too late with Him. We are human beings who are truly flawed and filled with sin. Our transgressions and wrongdoings are resolved with repentance and forgiveness from God. As long as we have one more chance and are still breathing, it is never too late. Sometimes, as people, we tend to seek and depend on others first before seeking God. We come forward to God with the utmost priority. God is very merciful and is always present for us. One of the fruits of the Lord is patience so therefore, we should abide by God’s timeline and not our own. Matthew 19:23 states:</p>



<p>“Then Jesus said to His disciples, ‘Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.’ When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished by saying, ‘Who then can be saved?’ But Jesus looked at them and said to them, ‘With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'”</p>



<p>The best weapon that we can actually use is prayer. Truly, nothing is impossible for God, no matter how old we are and no matter where we are at in life. When we serve God, we tend to put limits towards our actions. However, what God does for us is very limitless. He gathers all the necessary ingredients to formulate the purpose that He will deliver upon to us. Whatever we believe in, we must move forward with what God sees as righteous. God’s timing is always right and at His timing, our surroundings change. God manifests His promises unto us so that we can believe in Him with great ease. We must have childlike faith in God because in the end, it is never too late.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All. </p>

<p><em>By His delight the butterfly</em></p>



<p><em>To its appointment set</em></p>



<p><em>To change from crawling ‘pon the ground</em></p>



<p><em>To flower, dew made wet</em></p>



<p><em>And with her fluttering, thus attend</em></p>



<p><em>The promise, He has made</em></p>



<p><em>Pollinate the hearts of all</em></p>



<p><em>Thus, fill this vibrant glade</em></p>



<p>Every breath that we take and our life stories are all developed and planned out by God. We have witnessed the beauty of God’s creation. Most of the time, the occurrences and situations that we experience are a blessing in disguise. There is no doubt that we will endure challenges and struggles. Like a caterpillar, we grapple with and squirm from the negativities in our internal and external environments. This puts us in a helpless position where we are so vulnerable and at risk. Despite the vulnerability, God protects us and looks over us, just as how a chrysalis protects and encases the caterpillar. And when our appointed time arrives, we will emerge into someone more beautiful and holy and encounter greater and grander things in life, just as how the vulnerable caterpillar transforms into a beautiful and free butterfly. Ecclesiastes 3:1 states:</p>



<p>“There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven.”</p>



<p>To have God’s mighty arms around us and to dwell around Him is the best thing. It is time for us to realize the moment that we have to take action and tell everyone that God is indeed real. We are ambassadors, messengers, and representatives of God. In the appointed time, we must intensify and strengthen our beliefs and faith in order to lift ourselves up among countless troubles. </p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Have you not heard the message</em></p>



<p><em>Seen what He has done</em></p>



<p><em>Watched it take on substance</em></p>



<p><em>Its effect before we’ve won</em></p>



<p><em>Have you not beheld the shaping</em> </p>



<p><em>“The Way” of dreams long due</em></p>



<p><em>Listening to its footsteps</em></p>



<p><em>Saying, “He’s done something new”</em></p>



<p>It is all God’s doing that we are able to function and thrive, even during this unfortunate time of a pandemic. What is more important in this life is God and to spread the Word. Share the importance of His presence, above all. If we put God first, our aspirations and dreams will be God’s priority to give that to us. We do not need to see God in order to believe in Him. The beauty of God is the most powerful reminder that we always have to seek Him first and foremost. The wonders of God are everlasting and forevermore. Psalms 119:18 states: </p>



<p>“Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.”</p>



<p>God has ultimate control on what we do and what we plan on. Our knowledge of the past is imperfect at best. In addition, our relationships have power and meaning. If we want to establish and have a stronger relationship with God, we must look to Him first above all things. It is imperative to realize and acknowledge that God has put us on this Earth and blessed us as we are growing and developing. While there is always the possibility of doubt when we reach out to Him, remind yourselves daily that God is always going to be there for you and give you the answers you need.</p>

<p>Educators, from K-12 to the university level, are grappling with the new teaching environment that has limited traditional classroom interactions.&nbsp; The 2020 pandemic, caused by coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19), has caused pharmacy administrators, educators, staff, and students to adapt to new online teaching and learning strategies. Pharmacy education, therefore, had to be reinvented in some sense, enduring significant changes as compared to previous years. As the public struggles to understand COVID-19 and its transmission, along with constant governmental announcements, recommendations change daily and requires educators to accommodate the delivery of learning materials, adhere to testing procedures and integrity, as well as maintaining balance with their professional and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Distant learning initially involves the set-up of computers and applications that have good, clear connectivity to provide remote teaching. The ease of registering users and creating meeting invitations enable educators to spend less time navigating the technology and devote more time to didactic teaching. Assessing students through remote testing also presents with some challenges. The integrity of the examination process as displayed by students honestly has added some extra pressure to an already stressful situation with COVID-19. They must hold their identification in front of the camera, have the microphone and camera turned on throughout the examination, avoid wearing inappropriate attire, and not having extra materials nearby, such as notes, tablets, or books.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Experiential education is also being disrupted, with the challenges mainly due to site access and precautionary measures of having more people crowded in the same space. With these rotations being affected, acceptance to best practice sites are being delayed in some instances, thereby, minimizing opportunities for students to gain hands-on clinical experience. Some programs may however still choose to keep certain students at the practice sites while observing the pandemic response activity regionally. With the differences in acceptance, experiential leaders may find it arduous to offer the same experience to every student. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems like the fundamental essentials of sustaining good mental health while practicing social distancing are changing all aspects of everyday life. Maintaining the well-being of everyone in this unprecedented time is most important. There also must be a continuity of business operations, from disaster plan management to bookkeeping and facility maintenance. Non-essential personnel are now considered essential. With COVID-19 turning our world “upside down,” everyone must have resilience and constructive conversations to work collaboratively to continue to deliver didactic pharmacy education and growth, while still maintaining public safety.</p>

<p>The leadership team at American University of Health Sciences met with leaders and representatives from Mission Community Hospital on October 8, 2020. The meeting was intended to explore potential points of partnership between the great works being accomplished at AUHS and the wonderful efforts being achieved at Mission Community Hospital in Panorama City, Los Angeles. During the course of the meeting, there were multiple and potential areas of collaboration being discussed including nurse training rotations at Mission Community Hospital, the emerging Pharm.D. program, and the efforts to launch the new medical school.</p>



<p>Leaders and representatives from Mission Community Hospital were introduced to AUHS through a mutual friend of Dr. Glenn Marshak and the university, Sunny Koziol. “There are amazing people at AUHS and we are very excited to be working with them,” stated Dr. Marshak. As mentioned above, the three areas of training are significant points of connectivity between Mission Community Hospital and AUHS. Dr. John Spurling, Project Specialist at MCH, states that they are expanding their services to the community with efforts to gain recognition as a diverse, quality “teaching hospital” in the San Fernando Valley. Also, by working with AUHS, all of the requirements to make that dream into a reality in the very near future will happen.</p>



<p>Mission Community Hospital adds their sincere appreciation for the warm fellowship and a genuine sense of kindred spirits that they sensed at AUHS, as both institutions are exploring common points of commitment to lovingly serve the community.</p>

<p><em>I’m inspired by the love my Father gives</em></p>



<p><em>That brings me to places I would have never lived</em></p>



<p><em>That allows me to dream, and my dreams to soar</em></p>



<p><em>That makes a room in a castle and then opens the door</em></p>



<p><em>So, if there is something that causes you to doubt</em></p>



<p><em>Find your place before The Son, there you’ll find out</em></p>



<p><em>That all is possible, nothing withheld</em></p>



<p><em>God, the inspiration, of your sword and shield</em></p>



<p>We should all be inspired by God and His teachings. Nothing that we do or say is hidden because God can see the things that we are doing. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. However, that fear is not exactly the emotion of fear itself, but it is more as the sentiments of awe and wonder. Your story depends on who you are and where you are coming from. Always protect your heart and be careful of your heart as well. God comes in various forms and people have different, subjected perspectives of what they perceive God to be. One thing that is for sure though is that God’s covenant will remain the same forever. Ezekiel 37:26 states:</p>



<p>“And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary among them forever.”</p>



<p>A covenant from God is the seal of the Holy Spirit. It is a confirmation that sets the foundation of the relationship between you and God. In result, He will give you the desires of your heart. The seal of the Holy Spirit that is upon you signifies God’s given guidance and protection. Everywhere we look, look at examples of God’s influence and power.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Lift high the soul of those around</em></p>



<p><em>Who struggle through the storm</em></p>



<p><em>Who stay up late to watch with you</em></p>



<p><em>Protecting all from harm</em></p>



<p><em>With every chance remind them of</em></p>



<p><em>How important they are to you</em> </p>



<p><em>For is it not because of them</em></p>



<p><em>God makes your dreams come true</em></p>



<p>Sincerity is a very important factor in life. We sometimes do not acknowledge that sincerity towards others. In addition, we pass opportunities and neglect the things that are past us. Even a simple gesture such as a greeting, handshake, or fist bump can acknowledge someone’s presence and existence. Although these actions may seem quite minimal and simple, the meaning of that action implies so much. We need encouragement to strengthen us up. People may seem very positive and cheerful on the outside, but they may be broken on the inside and are going through many stressful hardships. However, at the end of the day, God is going to help clean up the mess that life throws at us. We have to catch the moment because the moment may not come back. 1 Thessalonians 5:11 states:</p>



<p>“Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.”</p>



<p>Every time you acknowledge others, no matter how simple they may be, you are hugging them. You are embracing them. You are lifting and building them up. Consider how every individual wants to be successful. Seeing the good things propel us to better and greater things. Be a blessing to others, despite the burdens that you are going through. We all make mistakes because God wants us to seek Him whenever we need to resolve issues. Not only is God our Father, but He is our whole team. Teamwork makes the dream work. We are indeed very blessed to see God among the negativities and sorrows that surround us. He is the refreshment that replenishes us and keeps us fulfilled.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>It’s not that we ourselves are good</em></p>



<p><em>Nor that we must because we should</em></p>



<p><em>But whenever we consider, and then think of</em></p>



<p><em>How much you gave, how much you love</em></p>



<p><em>We follow</em></p>



<p>How much do we really show our utmost devotion and loyalty to God? With many things that are happening around us in our daily lives, we often forget or ignore to turn our full, undivided attention towards our Heavenly Father. He is so focused and devoted to us, so why can’t we provide Him that in return? It is only natural that we do so. As our ultimate Dad and sole provider, God goes out of His way to make us happy and make sure that we are being fulfilled. In fact, He loves us so much that He blesses each and every one of us every single day. Jeremiah 17:14-16 states:</p>



<p>“Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; Save me and I shall be saved, For You are my praise. Indeed they say to me, ‘Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come now!’ As for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd who follows You.”</p>



<p>As sons and daughters of Jesus Christ and followers of God, it is imperative that we as Christians show our full, undivided attention to our Lord the Father. God is not a choice. God is a firm foundation who will remain with us now and for eternity. His Spirit and Word reigns on forever and His presence will never be lost and forgotten. It is our duty as Christians to ensure that His presence is made known to all.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p><em>Lay aside those things you have always cherished</em></p>



<p><em>Pain and sorrow, you chose, not forget</em></p>



<p><em>Unsheathe the blades that keep cutting</em></p>



<p><em>Go to Him, your need, He has met</em></p>



<p>All the things that are shackling and holding us down are the weights of life’s negativities. In order to cleanse ourselves from these negativities, we need to recognize God as our comfort and relief. We are blind, crippled, and motionless without God. Our relationship with Him is the way of detoxifying ourselves from the difficulties and hardships we are undergoing. It is not healthy to remain and become stuck in one place. Instead, take action by leaving away the excess baggage and picking yourself up to move on and seek God. It is a challenge for us to realize that sometimes, we cannot do it all. We become so enveloped and engrossed by pride that we become ignorant to seek guidance and help. Hebrews 12:1 states:</p>



<p>“Wherefore seeing, we also are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”</p>



<p>If we ask, it will be given to us. If we can get to our Heavenly Father, we will be alright. Being around God means that we have access to everything. In addition, pride is a reality issue. Many times, people often have pride but in reality, we need God. People need to realize that as God’s creation, there needs to be practical application of seeking Him everyday. Be proud that you are a believer of God. The Lord’s doing is the answer to your questions.</p>



<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

<p>If we really love God, then we would not have to wish for something bad or harmful towards those in spite. It is very ironic to say that there are indeed Christians who lash out and curse those who they do not like or agree with. In fact, why do we, as Christians, feel the need to put others down? Is it because they do not wholly agree with our beliefs or what we expect from them? This is not what God would want for His sons and daughters to approach and treat others. If we can practice all good things in the name of God, our perspectives and attitudes towards others will be justified and solidified in love. Galatians 5: 22-23 states:</p>



<p>“But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self-Control. Against such things, there is no law.”</p>



<p>Love is patient, love is kind, and love is the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Although we may not approve and see eye-to-eye with others, in the end, God shows his unconditional love towards everyone. And we should honor and show that as well.</p>

<p><em>I watch as Expecting, runs and plays</em></p>



<p><em>Behold where Trust with Confidence prays</em></p>



<p><em>Tis there that you often speak to me</em></p>



<p><em>Of things believed and I shortly see</em></p>



<p><em>Knowing you tend to everyone</em></p>



<p><em>A promise kept because your Son, saved me.</em></p>



<p>Every minute and every breath is a blessing. We run around so much among chaos that we forget about the little things that matter. In fact, we sometimes refuse to slow down because we are more focused on another task that distracts us. Why are we so intent on getting our personal tasks finished instead of taking the time to stop, reflect, and go towards hope? Hope is a fragrance. You want to keep your senses open in the aroma of God. This applies to surrounding yourselves with those who project that hopeful and positive energy. Romans 12:12 states:</p>



<p>“Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer.”</p>



<p>Hope is the fuel that allows us to continue and go on. God has placed us in this imperfect world because of our sins. However, when we take the time to stop and look at nature surrounding us, it is a reminder and portrayal that God has made things very beautiful despite a world that can be very bleak and corrupt. God attires us with righteousness because we are destined for victory. When we soil and taint our attire, the search for hope diminishes. God’s hope is so powerful because it aligns in the Father Almighty.</p>

<p>By: Nataly Mastov</p>



<p>I have always had a passion for helping others; this trait stems from the example my parents have set for me. I was exposed to consistent love and kindness, a respect my parents displayed to not only me, but strangers as well. I’ve experienced both poverty and wealth. I was raised in poverty, sharing a two-bedroom apartment with my family of six members. I watched my parents struggle as they attempted to create a comfortable life for my brothers and I. Their devotion to God, alongside their generosity and hard work, is what allowed me to experience life of wealth as well. My family now runs multiple home health businesses, which I would otherwise inherit. However, I have decided to take a different direction as this is not where my passion lies. I chose nursing with the similar intent that AUHS states; providing competent, caring, and evidence-based nursing services to diverse patient populations. I wish to build and develop my caring skills into something with academic backing so I know that as well as being well; meaning, my interventions can be medically effective.</p>



<p>The humanitarian qualities of nursing appeal deeply to me. My initial draw towards AUHS is due to my resonating belief that “all people have a right to healthcare and deserve a good quality of life.” After qualifying, I aspire to apply my nursing skills by working with a non-profit medical organization, possibly the Peace Corps or Medecins Sans Frontieres. In the longer term, I would like to continue my studies to earn an MSN online, alongside continuing to provide patient-centered nursing care in these settings.</p>



<p>As well as having solid ideals on the social values of nursing, I believe I possess the requisite practical talents and qualities of a good nurse. I have always shown a proclivity towards compassion and empathy, and combined this with a strong work ethic, critical thinking, determination and academic commitment. I would seek to apply these skills to the program. My genuine commitment to my patients drives me to seek out evidence-based intervention and demand high standards of myself and others in clinical practice. I am confident that this balance of skills makes me a rounded candidate. I am pleased to see this mirrored fundamentally in the blend of hands-on learning in a clinical setting (to apply care) alongside classroom-based academic learning (to acquire knowledge) throughout the program.</p>



<p>I recognize that nothing worth achieving comes easily. Becoming a nurse requires an exceptional work ethic, but also offers deep rewards. That is why I am prepared to dedicate myself, as I have in so many aspects of my past, to achieving this goal through enrolling in the program. I would strive to be an asset to the university, my patients and my calling. I know I would gain a deep sense of personal, professional and spiritual satisfaction from becoming a nurse, and I can think of no better place that I would rather begin this journey to enhance my career and life than at AUHS.</p>

<p>AUHS was recently awarded the NLM Grant for 18k. NLM, or the National Library of Medicine, is part of the National Institutes of Health and is the world’s largest biomedical library since its establishment in 1836. Located in Bethesda in the state of Maryland, the NLM is rich with history and also supports and conducts research, development, and training in the field of health and biomedical sciences. The funds will mainly go towards equipment for academic program and student use such as laptop computers and voice recorders, and will also compensate patients for participating. </p>



<p>By holding a community outreach, AUHS students will visit underserved hospitals that are located by the university or those that students are already associated with. Students will then interview patients about their health information needs. Lastly, they will demonstrate to patients on how to find health information by using the Internet and the NLM database.</p>



<p>The students will be trained on interviewing patients by an AUHS instructor, and will also be trained on researching by AUHS Librarian, Ms. June Kim. Students will also receive volunteer hours for their time.</p>

<p><em>Be wary of your state of mind</em></p>



<p><em>If you find offense when they seem unkind</em></p>



<p><em>If you become tired because they fail to say</em></p>



<p><em>They appreciate you and regard the day</em></p>



<p><em>Do not stop doing, what is right and good</em></p>



<p><em>Even if it seems, you must or should</em></p>



<p><em>For God has graced you with His mercy and love</em></p>



<p><em>So, act as He would, as from above</em></p>



<p>We can’t stop doing good when people do not show their appreciation for you. In fact, we have to continue to do good because we are sons and daughters of God. When we have issues, where do we go to? We go down the path towards God. We may not entirely see those who have wronged us, but we need faith to make us stronger while we overcome challenges. What God promises for us, there is no doubt that we will experience hurdles. It is not the end of the journey. Rather, we are being blessed along the process of the journey. Being spiritually driven is really our strength. Galatians 6:9 states:</p>



<p>“And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”</p>



<p>All of us have fallen short in the goodness of God. Always prefer God’s reward than man’s reward. While man is prone to disappointing others all the time, God never disappoints or lets us down. Despite all of the wrongdoings, we cannot be distracted or deterred on how people perceive our unique gifts. If we feel a sense of accomplishment and feeling of success in the name of God, we do not need to pursue anything further from the expectations of man. Essentially, it is good for God to give us directions and guidance. Everything we do has a rippling and prosperous effect in His name.</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics is the science of drug (<em>aka</em> pharmaco-) transformation and movement (<em>aka</em> -kinetics) in the human body. It studies the kinetics of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Its experimental and theoretical approaches involve analytical instrumentation and methodology, data collection and manipulation, mathematical model development and parameterization, and clinical interpretation and application. The study of pharmacokinetics is an important prerequisite for designing, predicating, modifying, and optimizing therapeutic dosing regimens for both individuals and groups of patients in today’s clinical practice.</p>



<p>The basic component of pharmacokinetics of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum is <em>PS733, Basic <a><span class=""has-inline-color has-black-color"">Pharmacokinetics</span></a></em>, a required course offered by the faculty of pharmaceutical sciences in the spring quarter of the P1 year. The prerequisite <em>introductory</em> courses include pathophysiology, biopharmaceutics, and pharmaceutical calculations.</p>



<p>There are a few tips for students who are going to take Basic Pharmacokinetics (PS733):</p>



<ul><li>Create a learning strategy that fits your individual learning style.</li><li>Actively engage into the learning activities in-class and off-class.</li><li>Focus on the basic concepts, models, formulas, and clinical interpretation and applications.</li><li>During and after class, summarize the course materials, extract the take-home information, highlight the key points, and interlink the concepts.</li><li>For assignments with calculations, understand what the question and the required formulas are, know the units and conversions, and round the numeric results accordingly.</li><li>For multiple choice questions in exams and quizzes, if you are not sure, stick with your initial choice (via the second or third thoughts).&nbsp; Also, check if your answer makes sense.</li><li>Lastly, here is a pop-up quiz question about pharmacokinetics for you with the answer that is located somewhere in this publication: <em>Define and compare the concepts of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>2020 has been wrought with many unfortunate events. From an ongoing pandemic, to societal issues regarding race and civil rights, to other worldly situations. This year has been defined as a year filled with tension and drastic challenges. Although this nation is in dire need for prayer, we should use this time in our lives to seek God now. In fact, we must seek Him in our everyday lives. Even when we experience struggles that may seem so minimal, God should not be ignored or put away to the side. God should not be removed because we need Him. The only hope that we have in times of trouble is God and God alone. Jeremiah 29:7 states:</p>



<p>“Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.”</p>



<p>One nation under God, by the people, for the people. Recently, this has been forgotten amongst everything that’s been going on, especially within politically driven leadership. One of the things that we have not done is paying attention to what others do. If we desire peace, we need to pray for good authority and leadership to guide us. The spirit of division that is politically charged has separated us. Despite the amount of freedom and democracy in the nation that we live in, we must express our prayers with wisdom and rationality. As God’s children, we are supposed to pursue righteousness. If we say that we love God and pray to Him, we must first love and pray for our nation.</p>

<p><span class=""has-inline-color has-black-color"">We don’t always see the goodness in God among the midst of everything that is happening around us. In result, we go our own ways and tend to be hasty with the decisions that we make. We have to wait and trust in God, despite how impatient we may be. There is a reason why we are still here on this Earth. It is very important to know that in the process, God is planning out bigger and greater things for us. During this time of waiting, we must and should also practice a lot of self-reflection. It is like running on a treadmill with a deep and steep incline. The process will be tough and energy will be lost, but God is indeed preparing and training us for something grand. Lamentations 3:25 states:</span></p>



<p><span class=""has-inline-color has-black-color"">“The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.”</span></p>



<p><span class=""has-inline-color has-black-color"">What we ask from God won’t happen instantly. God has to be faithful to His word. Those who stray away from God because they did not receive the answer that they are looking for are not genuine in their hearts to seek God. Rather, it is just instant self-gratification. Be busy mending your nets and work for your preparations. Trust in God more than you trust in man. Man takes back his words and actions all the time, but God will never go that route. Our patience is an indication of our faith. Pray and wait in anticipation, for God is going to grant your request. Trust in Him.</span></p>

<p class=""has-black-color has-text-color"">The concept of musical brain is of considerable interest in today’s neuroscience. Research on how the brain processes music is emerging as a rich and stimulating area of investigation such as emotion and cognition. This communication discusses how music would be a valuable tool to probe multifold cognitive functions and its utility as a candidate therapy for treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Music is the universal art and unique feature of human civilization that exists in every culture around the world. Listening to music is an appealing experience where an individual immerses oneself perceiving internal focus/mediation/spiritual awareness. Recent experimental findings indicate that music has the potential to guide attention towards sensory cues and prevent fatigue-related signals from entering focal awareness. The brain mechanisms underlying such effects are primarily associated with theta waves – the waves that are strong during internal focus, meditation, and spiritual awareness. Among musical components, a repetitive rhythm appears to play a significant role in regulating physiologic and behavioral functions through the synchronization of biological rhythms with musical rhythm based on acoustic resonance. Additionally, regular rhythmic patterns facilitate memory encoding and decoding of non-musical information making music as an efficient mnemonic tool. Music with its unique ability to access motivational systems in the brain, provides time-structure enhancing perception process for language, motor, and cognitive learning. The evidence from basic and clinical neuroscience suggests that listening to music involves many cognitive components with distinct brain substrates. The effect of music on specific brain regions, as measured by neurophysiology and neuroimaging techniques, have unfolded functional neuronal network connectivity and activation of target brain regions between the auditory cortex, the reward brain system, and the learning/memory brain system. Musical stimuli have been shown to activate specific pathways in specific brain regions including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, insula, and cingulate/pre-frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, which are all critically involved in emotions and cognition. In addition, neurochemical studies have suggested that music stimulates the secretion of several hormonal mediators such as endorphins, endocannabinoids, dopamine, serotonin, and melatonin which are known to play significant roles in emotional and cognitive integrity. Thus, music has a big role to play not only for the general well-being but for mental health as well.</p>

<em>You may not perceive or clearly see<br>
What is at hand in your destiny<br>
You may wonder and even doubt it will come<br>
‘Til you remember, you’re saved by The Son</em></p>
<p>It takes faith and a good heart to trust in God and remember what He has done for us. Everything that happens in our lives is an opportunity that opens the door for us. As human beings, there are challenges and obstacles that may cause us to lose hope. Whenever there are big problems and challenges, it should not be perceived as a bad thing. Rather, it is a blessing in disguise to help us see that we are blessed in the mess that we are in. It is a challenge to endure this mess in order find out that we can overcome this and be blessed along the way. The bigger the opportunity, the less it makes sense. Opportunities come at the right time in God’s glory. Ecclesiastes 3:14 states:<br>
“I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.”<br>
God is the Director of the universe. The script that He provides for us is never certain or set in stone. In fact, we have to “go with the flow” with and for God. There is no doubt that we are always looking at our timelines. In result, things don’t always go according to plan. Ironically, we need these trials and tribulations to realize that we don’t become full of ourselves. God is our daily reminder and refresher that we really need in our lives now and for eternity.</p>

In the United States, each year ~50,000 people die with TBI, ~230,000 people with TBI are hospitalized, and ~90,000 people experience long-term disability after TBI. Each year, an estimated 1.7 million cases of TBI occur in the United States, of which 80.7% (~1,365,000) are emergency outpatients, 16.3% (~275,000) are hospitalized, and 3.0% (~52,000) people die with TBI. Currently, ~5.3 million Americans are living with TBI-related functional/cognitive impairments. According to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, statistics show that there have been ~220,430 documented cases of TBI in the military to date.<br>
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-18042 alignleft"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-1.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""210"">TBI is an acquired form of brain injury that is defined as a damage to the brain, resulting from external mechanical forces caused by rapid acceleration or deceleration due to the mechanical impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile. With particular reference to the combat situation, the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) have defined TBI as, “A traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the clinical signs, including any period of decreased or loss of consciousness (LOC) or any period of post-traumatic amnesia or any alteration of cognition (confusion, disorientation, slow-thinking), immediately following the event” (DVA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, 2009). The most common causes of TBI include accidental falls, assault/violence, motor vehicle-traffic, construction, and sports. TBI has a greater prevalence among children (0-14 years of age) and older people (&gt;65 years of age); and with a greater occurrence among males than females. The military casualty statistics on fatal brain injuries during the Iraq/Afghanistan wars have added to this devastation. Generally, TBI can be classified into three main categories: (1) A closed head injury (cTBI) (also called non-penetrating or blunt injury) that occurs when the brain is not exposed to the primary injury-causative factor; (2) A penetrating or open head injury (pTBI) that occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain, damaging the brain parenchyma; (3) An explosive blast injury (also previously referred to as “Shell Shock” injury) that occurs when the head is impacted by the high frequency blast waves generated from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or improvised rocket assisted mortars (IRAMs) (bTBI). TBI is also classified based on linear or rotational acceleration/deceleration impacted by external force on the brain. Acceleration/deceleration of the brain due to linear impact to the head (such as in pTBI or cTBI in some cases) is termed as “focal” injury, while the acceleration/deceleration of the brain due to rotational impact (such as in bTBI or cTBI in some cases) is termed as “diffuse” injury. War-related bomb and blast injury (bTBI) could be viewed as closed or diffuse head injury.<br>
Depending upon the severity, brain injuries can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe TBI. The classic Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ranging from 3–15 is widely used for categorizing TBI severity based on verbal, motor, and eye-opening reactions to stimuli. It is generally agreed that a TBI with a GCS of 13 or above is mild, a GCS between 9–12 is moderate, and a GCS of 8 or below is severe. A current classification model <img loading=""lazy"" class="" wp-image-18043 alignleft"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-300x139.png"" alt="""" width=""410"" height=""190"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-300x139.png 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-768x355.png 768w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.png 857w"" sizes=""(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"">developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) applies the entire criteria of GCS after resuscitation, duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC), that is proposed to detect changes such as swelling, focal lesions, or diffuse injury that are visible on neuroimaging. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy by producing immediate and long-term cellular/molecular, neuropathological, neurochemical, neurodegenerative and psychological consequences that may arise and persist for months to years of post-injury.<br>
Recently, there has been an increased awareness regarding the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a disease process and not an “event” which leads to immediate, long-lasting and debilitating impairments in cognition, psychological health, and sensorimotor abilities. Recent post-mortem studies on athletes suggest that repeated concussive or mild TBIs are a risk factor for the long-term development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and possibly, other neurodegenerative pathologies and conditions as well. Overall, the literature reviewed thus far suggests that the chronic effects after a single moderate/severe TBI leads to Alzheimer-like changes while the long-term consequences of repetitive mild TBI lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Both forms of single and repetitive TBI with any gradation of severity produce psychological and cognitive deficits ranging from headaches/dizziness to dementia, depending upon various factors during aging after single or repetitive TBI. Currently, the treatment for TBI is limited. Given the recent statistics of TBI, finding effective treatment for TBI is a global priority.<br>
Traumatic Brain Injury, otherwise known as craniocerebral trauma or simply TBI, has become increasingly prevalent in recent times. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 1.7 million cases of TBI that occur each year. According to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, a branch of the U.S. Military Health System, there have been nearly 220,430 confirmed cases in the military to date. As of now, approximately 5.3 million Americans are living with cognitive and functional complications due to TBI. This global health crisis has been identified as a leading cause of disability and death. The most common cause of TBI, however, are damages to the brain caused by an external physical force which occurs in motor/vehicular accidents, assaults, contact sports, falls, and much more. While TBI does not occur from internal factors such as a medical condition (i.e. seizures, a stroke, etc.), the outcome of TBI can produce long-lasting physical and psychological effects. These effects may result in dizziness, sensitivity to light and/or noise, headaches, migraines, visual impairment, and post-traumatic epilepsy. Furthermore, TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy by producing immediate and long-term cellular/molecular, neuropathological, neurochemical, neurodegenerative, and psychological consequences that may arise and persist for months to years of post-injury.<br>
TBI is generally classified into three main categories: 1) a closed head injury (also called non-penetrating or blunt injury, or simply cTBI) that occurs when the brain is not exposed to the primary injury-causative factor, 2) a penetrating or open head injury (pTBI) that occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater – the outermost membrane surrounding the brain – damaging the brain parenchyma, and 3) an explosive blast injury (known as “Shell Shock” injury or simply bTBI) that occurs when the head is instantly impacted by high frequency blast waves generated from the surroundings of a hazardous environment that is high-risk. To classify the levels of severity in TBI, it can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. The classic Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological scale that is used to assess patients who are in a coma. The scale provides a score that ranges from 3–15, whi<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-18044 alignright"" src=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-300x300.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" srcset=""https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-300x300.png 300w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-150x150.png 150w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-100x100.png 100w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-140x140.png 140w, https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4.png 321w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"">ch is widely used for categorizing the severity of TBI based on verbal, motor, and eye-opening reactions to outside stimuli. It is generally agreed that a TBI with a GCS score of 13 or above is mild, a GCS score between 9–12 is moderate, and a GCS score of 8 or below is severe.<br>

<p>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a global health crisis, and a leading cause of disability and death. It is an acquired form of brain injury that is defined as a damage to the brain, resulting from external physical forces caused by rapid acceleration or deceleration due to impacts, blast waves, or projected penetration. The most common causes of TBI include accidental falls, assault/violence, motor vehicle-traffic, construction, and contact sports. Recently, there has been an increased awareness regarding the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

<em>I have determined to be that much fitter</em><br>
<em>Get in shape for the great things to come</em><br>
<em>To live long and have joy in His promise</em><br>
<em>For every trial, He has bade, we have won</em></p>
<p>The pursuit of happiness. This is a familiar saying that we have probably heard numerous times before. While family, friends, and other aspects in life may make us joyful, the love for God is true and genuine happiness. Joy is one of the many things that God wants us to experience in our lives. It is natural for us to feel sorrow and frustration when things fall apart and do not go our way. However, while these negative sentiments may linger on, they do not remain forever. We allow ourselves for these feelings to overcome and overwhelm us, but we must not take heed to that. The absence of gratitude and light becomes a dark void in our lives. God is asking us to remain in His love. James 1:2 states:<br>
“Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.”<br>
Your attitude determines your outcome. Nothing happens in us unless God steps in and give us enlightening opportunities and joyous moments. When we endure trials and tribulations, the outcome will be an immense positive result from God. Trials and tribulations are a way to get us back into shape. God wants us to stay fit and prepare for the great things that He promised. He never takes back His word and will grant His promise. Therefore, have faith and joy in God.</p>

Then saw a horizon, seemed far, not near<br>
I went on further and then I knew<br>
I’ve much further to go if I’m to be like you</em>&lt;</p>
<p>See yourself as God sees you. Looking at a mirror is similar to giving the chance to reflect upon yourself, literally and figuratively. Our actions and words reflect ourselves as a whole. What is the “God-like” quality that we are supposed to have? Well, for one, we have to start by acknowledging and respecting God’s authority and presence. The spirit of God is in us, so we must follow Him in the name of the Holy Spirit. Psalms 51:0 states:<br>
“Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”<br>
God is a gracious and forgiving entity. When we reflect on ourselves and realize the many flaws we possess, we have to come forward to God to have Him cleanse and purify us, to purge us from our sins and troubles. Satan will continue to push on and guilt-trip us because he knows that we are very vulnerable and prone to fall under temptation. Therefore, it is important to pause for a bit and take the time to self-reflect. Retreats and personal quiet time with God are great ways to self-reflect and purify ourselves. However, we cannot solely rely on these to fix our internal flaws. Communicating with God on a daily basis is key to checking ourselves.</p>

 Unity Under Authority,https://news.auhs.edu/unity-under-authority/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/21-600x403.jpg,Noonday Prayer,"<p>There is a reason why we are called brothers and sisters in Christ. Fellowship is an important part of the Christian religion. With fellowship, the aspects of bonding and unity brings us closer together. In result, we become family in a spiritual and emotional sense. However, when that bond and unity is broken, disunity and division occur. A prime example of disunity and division is Lucifer, the disgraced and fallen angel. As one of the many divine angels from heaven, Lucifer became very arrogant and prideful. This sense of pride and self-indulgence separated him from God, which created division and later led to his downfall from the Kingdom of Heaven. Titus 3:10 states:<br>
“Reject a divisive man after a first and second admonition.”<br>
If you want to gain power, do it in the right and proper way by uplifting others around you and making them powerful as well. 1 Thessalonians 5:11 states:<br>
“Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.”<br>
If you do something that is against God’s anointed, then you are lacking concern and understanding. It is no doubt that we have a bit of Lucifer in us. We have to catch ourselves before we hurt others and avoid questioning authority, which is our Heavenly Father.</p>

Christians are defined as followers and believers of Jesus Christ and His teachings. By identifying ourselves as Christians, we must follow in Christ’s footsteps and under His light to become more Christ-like. However, when we project our Christ-like appearance and mannerisms but demonstrate sinful and unjust behavior at the same time, we are portraying ourselves as hypocrites. The heart and soul of a hypocrite is not genuine and true to one’s own actions and words. This equates to deceitfulness and a “two-faced” image that is being displayed. 2 Timothy 3:5 states:<br>
“Having the appearance of godliness but denying its power. Avoid such people.”<br>
It is no doubt that we are subjected to hypocritical behavior. We do or say one thing but do or say another. In addition, Matthew 15:8 states:<br>
“These people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.”<br>
Although we are no strangers to taking back our actions and words, we must not become further influenced by those who push this negative image and behavior. In doing so, we have to heed away and avoid certain people who are channeling this manipulation and influence that is coming from Satan. We are God’s warriors and with His power, we can overcome anything.</p>

 Though Flawed,https://news.auhs.edu/though-flawed/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6.jpg,Morning Too,"<p><em>Though flawed in everything I see<br>
His steadfast love reminding me<br>
That He is there to have and to hold<br>
So even flawed, humbled and bold, I return to Him</em></p>
<p>What is a perfectionist? A perfectionist is defined as someone who consistently strives for flawlessness and sets excessively high-performance standards, accompanied by overly critical self-evaluations and concerns regarding others’ evaluations. However, no matter how much we want our plans, aspirations, and goals to be perfect, they may never turn out to be how we want it to be. Sinners are far from being perfect. In fact, as sinners, we are the most flawed individuals. We are the worst sinners we ourselves know. Jesus Christ was brought into this world as an example for us. He is a daily reminder that because He died for our sins, God still loves us with the utmost and unconditional humility. He sacrificed His own son for us, and that says a lot. Micah 7:18 states:<br>
“Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in steadfast love.”<br>
During Morning Too prayer service, AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that we need to know how much God loves us. No matter how much we push Him away, we cannot escape God and His love. He is our eternal Father and as the ultimate Father figure, He cherishes each and every one of us, no matter how flawed, imperfect, and oppressed we are. God uses us to glorify Himself because he is not ashamed and embarrassed of us. He never gives up on His children, period. It is up to us to do our very best and give all of our efforts to recognize and serve God, so that we can uplift Him while He uplifts us. Always and forever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identification of high-affinity small molecules that modulate the activity of target proteins has been used as a classical approach in the drug discovery and development process. Small molecule inhibitors not only have high cell permeability, which make them possible to target intracellular proteins, but also their size conform to Lipinski’s rule of five, which generally ensures them to be orally administered, thus leading to small molecule inhibitors being the main targeted treatment towards intracellular proteins. However, there are limitations that obstruct the durable clinical effectiveness of small molecule drugs. First of all, the inhibition is induced by occupying the active site of the target proteins. Only 25% of human proteomes are druggable, but the majority of human proteins such as transcription factors, non-enzymatic proteins, or scaffolding proteins, either lack active sites or have active sites but are barely suitable for occupying, thus making 75% of human proteomes undruggable. Second, sustainably high drug dosages are necessary for having therapeutic efficiency that often cause off-target effects. Third, the continuous exposure to the inhibitors can induce the mutation of target proteins, finally causing drug resistance.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce a novel technology that has the potential to overcome most of the limitations of small molecule inhibitors. Human cells have natural mechanism to dispose proteins that are mutated, misfolded, or no longer needed. Any proteins that are tagged for disposal are then crushed by a cell’s own shredder, the proteasome. Many researchers have been trying to harness this mechanism selectively in the fight against diseases such as cancers. If it was possible to attach a disposal label to the proteins that cancer requires, these would inevitably be shredded by the proteasome, finally inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have been extensively used as one of the protein degraders. PROTACs are hetero-bifunctional molecules, consisting of two different ligands and a linker between the ligands. One ligand is as a warhead to target the protein of interest and the other ligand is responsible for recruiting an E3 ligase. The rationale behind this design is that by bringing the E3 ligase in the close proximity of the protein of interest, ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the target protein will be triggered.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/articles/proteolysis-targeting-chimeras-protacs-a-new-therapeutic-modality/attachment/3-2/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-17855""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-17855 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-300x110.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""110""></a></p>
<p>There are several major milestones for the development of PROTACs. The concept of PROTAC was introduced for the first time by Dr. Craig Crews and his colleagues from Yale University in 2001, and then the first peptide PROTAC was developed. In 2008, the first small-molecule PROTAC based on MDM2 E3 ligase was reported. The small-molecule PROTACs based on different E3 ligase, IAP1 were developed in 2010, and VHL and CRBN based PROTACs in 2015.

<em>My Dad waited for me ‘til the morning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked for me all night<br>
Rose early that He might bless &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Til I rid of fear and fright</em></p>
<p>We are not entirely certain when our time may arrive. It may be tomorrow, a week from now, or even several years from now. Regardless of time, we have to prepare for whatever God is going to deliver upon us. Preparation is an indication of expectation. What we expect from God is always going to be awesome and grand. These expectations that we are anticipating from God are always guaranteed to happen. It is why we should not ever be doubtful about what we should expect from Him. Rather, we should impregnate ourselves with faith and with God’s expectations. What right do we have to give up on our faith and expectations from the Lord Almighty? Isaiah 30:18 states:<br>
“Therefore, the Lord longs to be gracious to you; therefore, He rises to show you compassion, for the Lord is a just God. Blessed are all who wait for Him.”<br>
During this morning’s Morning Too service, AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that everything we do must be excellent in the name of the Heavenly Father. In fact, we can never change or manipulate God’s promise and love for us, His children. As the ideal and ultimate Father figure, God will never shy away or reject us, and this is one of the many blessings and deliverances that we can undoubtedly expect from Him.</p>

 Altars to God,https://news.auhs.edu/altars-to-god/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/noonprayer93-596x403.jpg,Noonday Prayer,"<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/noonday-prayer/altars-to-god/attachment/thumbnail_image002/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-17882""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-17882 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thumbnail_image002-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>In that place where you wrongly built before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tear it down ‘til it be no more</em><br>
<em>Destroy and grind what you played homage to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To God alone, is your worship due</em></p>
<p>How often do we dedicate our full attention towards God? We tend to become so busy and caught up with numerous distractions and noises in our daily lives that pull us away from maintaining a connected relationship with our Heavenly Father. A place of worship is God’s place. It is His home and where there is an altar for God, the time spent in that altar and/or place of worship is solely focused on God and God alone. With these many noises that distract us, we become so engulfed in worshipping and focusing our attention on other things. These things can include our careers and even material items such as money, cars, and homes. These things can only go so far in our lives, but our relationship with and focus on God is eternal. 1 Chronicles 21:22 states:<br>
“Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build on it an altar to the Lord; for the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be restrained from the people.”<br>
An altar is a reminder that God’s presence is all around us. It is a sanctuary filled with God’s peace and word. During the Noon Day Prayer service, AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that as believers, we must not forget how much God has provided for us and that we must show our utmost gratitude and love to Him in return. It is at the altar where we can encounter God and connect with Him at a deeper and personal level.</p>

<em>Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds; for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations. (Proverbs 27:23-24)</em></p>
<p>The latest highlights and trends instigate people to desire more of what they already own or have. As humans, we want to feel good and satisfied about ourselves. When we earn something that we want, it naturally makes us content. However, sometimes, that happiness can only go for so long. Even the wealthiest of millionaires may experiences their dissatisfaction with what it is going on in their lives, despite the money and assets that they have. On the flip side, those who live modestly in simple, smaller residences and who do not even own many possessions may experience happiness that makes them feel wholesome.<br>
To acquire happiness is not acquiring the latest material items or earning the highest salary. These components are only temporary and can change in the blink of an eye. But God’s love and word is everlasting and permanent. That defines genuine happiness and satisfaction. People tend to want more and more of what they already possess and have, which ensues in greed and the constant need for self-satisfaction. Therefore, abundance and quantity should not be based on materialistic features, but rather in faith and spirit.</p>

<em>Faith is defined as a complete trust or confidence in someone or something.</em><br>
<em>Faith is the substance we hope for, the evidence of what we do not see. (Hebrews 11:1)</em></p>
<p>Faith is something that we cannot physically see through our outer eyes. There is no magical wand that will grant us the answers that we need or are waiting for. Instead, faith is seen through our inner eyes, meaning that from the time that we are young, faith is already instilled in us and in our souls. When we lose our grip on faith, that is when our prayers are not fulfilled and answered. We must bring our forthcomings and kneel before God in order to firmly stabilize and maintain our faith. During this morning’s Morning Too service, Dr. Mok Chong, Chair and Professor of the Department of Clinical and Administrative Sciences at the School of Pharmacy, stated that we must not lose our faith, just like how the Biblical figure Hannah did not lose her faith in the Heavenly Father. Hannah endured many trials and tribulations during the times when she was not able to conceive. However, her patience and instilled faith conquered, and God blessed her with a beautiful baby boy named Samuel. So, take this reminder to your heart and soul. Without God, there is no faith and without faith, God is not there.</p>

<strong>Author</strong>: Dr. Sukhwinder Lakhman, Department of Pharmaceutical Science, American University of Health Sciences, Signal Hill, Ca<br>
It is a well-known concept that human exposure to biodiverse natural environment carries ecological benefits. For example, green spaces with a higher eco-system function give children further exposure to more diversity of microbiota. “The more diversity in microbiota that a child is exposed to, the healthier they grow up,” said the lead author of the journal “Restoration Ecology” in his paper, Ph.D. Candidate, Jacob Mills. Dr. Mills is from the University of Adelaide’s School of Biological Sciences and Environment Institute and he reiterates the idea that historically, humans have lived in more rural and wild landscapes, and children spent more of their childhood outdoors, allowing further exposure to more microbes.</p>
<p>Urbanization has radically changed our childhoods. After the shift from more rural areas to the urban developments, there has been a big change in the vegetation and microbiota due to the regular use of insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides.</p>
<p>Additionally, children spend more time indoors (playing video games), and eating processed, poor quality foods. The decreased exposure to wild environments has led to significant increases in non-communicable diseases such as early onset of diabetes, poor mental health, and significant increases in respiratory health such as asthma as a result of exposure to the unhealthy, poor quality air.</p>
<p>It is believed that a microbiome rewilding process could expose us to a greater variety and number of microbiota (organisms living within a specific environment) and provide our bodies with a form of immune system training and regulation. There are microbial compounds in soil that reduce stress and anxiety as well.</p>
<p>The study results of Mills et al., 2020, provide us with a plan of action for urban planners and designers. More specifically, where to place the environmental microbiomes and where to access the diverse green spaces in their designs when developing and rejuvenating urban areas.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>I had lost all my strength<br>
Found myself shaken and alone<br>
It was then that you called to me. Lifted me. Held me.<br>
Brought me back to home</em></p>
<p>Life throws us many curveballs, whether they are big or small, positive or negative, life-changing or ordinary. With many curveballs that are thrown at us, we can become very tired and weary of certain situations that may stress us out even more. In fact, it is common for us to isolate ourselves and avoid seeking any form of advice or sustenance that will lift us up. Perhaps this is due to our self-pride, that we don’t need anyone to help us and that we are intelligent enough to get through a situation by ourselves. However, we cannot keep believing that we can do it alone. Instead, during these times of fatigue and pressure, we must come forward to our ultimate Father, the Lord God. Isaiah 40:31 states:<br>
“Yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary.”<br>
During this afternoon’s Noon Day Prayer service, AUHS Founder Dr. Kim Dang-Johnson expressed that when we solely rely on ourselves to get out of a rut, we are going to continue to keep falling into holes that we cannot get out of. The paths that we take and choose to go to will only be filled with holes along the way if we keep relying on ourselves, and not on God. God is the answer to our prayers, our requests, and our everything. Through Him, we will rise up like eagles preparing to fly.</p>

<p>On August 25, 2020, staff members and the School of Pharmacy faculty at American University of Health Sciences held a morning prayer session to pray for the succession of the visitations from the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). The visitations, which will last from August 25-27, will determine full candidacy status. Several faculty members from the School of Pharmacy and School of Nursing attended the morning prayer session through ZOOM. During this time, all of the faculty, staff, and students at AUHS and the School of Pharmacy have carefully prepared for the visit and are excited to showcase the many achievements from this past academic year.</p>

 Be Careful,https://news.auhs.edu/be-careful/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-600x403.jpg,Morning Dew,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/morningDew824.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-17702 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/morningDew824-300x169.jpg"" alt="""" width=""556"" height=""313""></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Careful, attend, to where they go&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By words, discomfort, uncertainty sow</em><br>
<em>They make you uncomfortable, in what’re you do&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While declaring this, their love is true</em><br>
<em>If unhappiness, apprehension, constant you feel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most assuredly, their love’s not real</em><br>
<em>A user, perverse, seeing you as toys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In truth, their words, just noise</em></p>
<p>When it comes to relationships and connecting with others around us, trust is an important factor. Trust binds and solidifies that bond between you and another individual and/or party. However, trust can indeed become broken when there is a rift in the relationship. This rift is typically caused by the other individual breaking that trust by betraying you, lying behind your back, or stating falsified rumors or remarks. It is very imperative that we as Christians avoid those who do not stand by us and instead, spew out negativity and two-faced gestures and actions. This is very similar to what Samson experienced with his relationship with Delilah. Judges 16:16 states:<br>
“And Delilah said to Samson, ‘Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and where with thou mightiest be bound to afflict thee. And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death. That he told her all his heart. Upon learning the secret of Samson’s strength, Delilah betrayed him to the Philistines, who imprisoned and blinded him.”<br>
In the Biblical story of Samson and Delilah, Samson, a Nazirite, fell in love with Delilah, a Philistine woman. Because of his love and adoration for her, Samson fully confided in Delilah and even revealed to her the secret of his strength after much pestering and goading. Delilah then betrayed Samson by having his locks of hair cut off, which removed his almighty strength, just because she was tempted by an exchange of monetary benefits offered by other fellow Philistines. In result, Samson became helpless, had his eyes gouged out, and died with thousands of people when God gave him the final strength to push down the pillars that surrounded them. This is a very sad and unfortunate ending to this Biblical story, but Samson died as a man who honored, loved, and trusted God. And this story should be a lesson to all of us in the long-run. We should not be distracted by outsiders who create unnecessary noise and toxicity. In terms of trust, choose the right people to stand with you but most of all, trust in God. Always.</p>

<p><strong>Author: Dr. Jonathan Sheng</strong></p>
<p>This summer, the School of Pharmacy at American University of Health Sciences successfully completed its first academic year. Its inaugural Doctor of Pharmacy class, the class of 2022, have fulfilled all their first year (P1)’s academic requirements and entered their second-year (P2)’s training. A major portion of the second-year Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum at American University of Health Sciences is an integrated therapeutic course series, which consists of nine individual integrated therapeutic courses themed by human physiological systems:</p>
<p>CS 851 Integrated Pharmacotherapy I-Fluids Electrolytes and Hematology with Lab<br>
CS 852 Integrated Pharmacotherapy II-Cardiology with Lab<br>
CS 861 Integrated Pharmacotherapy III-Pulmonary and Nephrology with Lab<br>
CS 862 Integrated Pharmacotherapy IV-Gastroenterology and Endocrinology with Lab<br>
CS 871 Integrated Pharmacotherapy V-Psychiatry and Neurology with Lab<br>
CS 872 Integrated Pharmacotherapy VI-Infectious Disease with Lab<br>
CS 881 Integrated Pharmacotherapy VII-Oncology and Nutrition with Lab<br>
CS 882 Integrated Pharmacotherapy VIII-Urology and Reproductive System with Lab<br>
CS 911 Integrated Pharmacotherapy IV-Dermatology and Rheumatology with Lab</p>
<p>These are horizontally integrated therapeutic courses that bridge the P1 year’s coursework in basic sciences and the P3 year’s clinical training. In these integrated courses, the knowledge of basic sciences for the therapeutic portion of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum will be delivered alongside its clinical counterpart, and both didactic and practical experience sessions will be provided to the students. The integrated courses will be taught by a team of multidisciplinary faculty members from the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Department of Clinical and Administrative Sciences at American University of Health Sciences with appropriate academic backgrounds and expertise ranging from pathophysiology to pharmacology, from pharmacokinetics to toxicology, and from medicinal chemistry to pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p>Studies1,2 have shown that the teaching format of multidisciplinary integration is effective to improve the critical thinking and problem-solving skills of students and allow them to gain clinically relevant and coherent learning experiences in the classroom early on. At the same time, the integrated courses also provide opportunities for faculty members involved to work collaboratively. They are able to put their time and efforts together to design and implement the integrated therapeutic curriculum and learner-centered pedagogical strategies further efficiently.</p>
<p>However, there are drawbacks of integrated courses. For instance, some integrated disciplines, such as clinical chemistry and toxicology, do not contribute to the course content and assessment as much as other disciplines do, and they are often not fully appreciated by all learners, or do not receive as much attention of instructors as other disciplines receive. There is often resistance to the change from traditional one-discipline course learning to integrated multidisciplinary course learning. The resistance, which needs to be overcome, is not only from students but also from faculty and there are often disagreements on course content among instructors and students.</p>
<p>There are both benefits and challenges for students taking the integrated multidisciplinary courses. Students, most of whom are from the culture of traditionally taught one-discipline courses, will have to work harder and be prepared to face more academic challenges from the integrated multidisciplinary courses than the traditional non-multidisciplinary courses, especially when they are enrolled in an accelerated program such as the 3-year accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy program at American University of Health Sciences.</p>
<p>This summer, the second cohort of Doctor of Pharmacy students of American University of Health Sciences, the class of 2023, have also arrived and our new P1 students have already started their first year’s course work virtually. Welcome, Class of 2023!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>I cannot begin to fathom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The depths of our Father’s love</em><br>
<em>That while, we’re still imperfect&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He still reigns from above</em><br>
<em>Torrents of blessings&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am in awe and humbled by His Love</em></p>
<p>Our God is an awesome God. He watches over us, loves us unconditionally, and provides us with everything that we ask for. He is also a very patient God. As sinners, we tend to fall into the traps of many sins that tempt us and distract us away from our spiritual relationship with God. So, why does God still deal with us and stick with us through thick and thin? Why hasn’t He given up on us, despite the countless acts of sin that are performed? Why does He still watch over us no matter how many times we have disappointed or hurt Him? The ultimate reason is that He loves us. No matter what. No matter how flawed we are, no matter how problematic our actions may cause, God is humble and shows His forgiving and nurturing devotion to us. Romans 5:10 states:<br>
“For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life.”<br>
During this morning’s prayer service, AUHS Founder Ms. Kim Dang-Johnson stated that although life throws us many trials, tribulations, and challenges, we are given God’s gift to renew and refresh ourselves when the next day arrives. A new day defines a new beginning and metaphorically, we have a reset button instilled in us to start over and keep our mind, body, and spirit at ease. As the weekend is nearing, remind yourself that God is always going to be there for you, no matter how difficult and challenging life may be. With Him and Him alone, you can get through anything.</p>

 Design and Development of Novel Cyclophilin: A Inhibitors for the Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus Infections,https://news.auhs.edu/design-and-development-of-novel-cyclophilin-a-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infections/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article820-300x191-1.png,Articles,"<p><strong>Author:</strong> Suhui Yang, PhD, Assistant Professor, College of Pharmacy, American University of Health Sciences, Signal Hill, CA 90755</p>
<p>Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver and is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Chronic infection with HCV is a high-risk factor for developing serious liver diseases, particularly cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. HCV infection is a major health burden that affects more than 170 million people around the world, ultimately leading to more than 300,000 deaths per year. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), including inhibitors of nonstructural proteins (NS3/4A protease, NS5A, and NS5B polymerase), represent key components of anti-HCV treatment. The combined DAAs therapy has higher efficacy than their monotherapy. However, there are still issues of increased drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and unwanted side effects. This requires identification of a new class of anti-HCV agents with potential to replace existing regimen.</p>
<p>Cyclophilins (Cyps) are a family of highly conserved cellular peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIase) and are involved in cellular processes including protein folding and trafficking. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is the most abundant member in the family, and its critical role in supporting HCV-specific RNA replication and viral protein expression has been demonstrated in several reports. To date, most of the existing Cyp inhibitors are derived from two natural products, cyclosporine A (CsA) and sanglifehrin A, thus sharing the same structural backbone. However, the disadvantages of such large CsA-like structures, including high risk of having clinical safety profiles, complex synthetic route, and high cost, have led to identification and development of small-molecule compounds as novel CypA inhibitors for HCV treatment.</p>
<p></p><center><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article820.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-17634"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article820-300x191.png"" alt="""" width=""426"" height=""271""></a></center>Dr. Yang was majorly contributed in the identification and development of bis-amides as novel CypA inhibitors [1]. The published research article in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was the first successful report on bis-amides as enzymatically active, site-directed inhibitors of CypA. The lead compound 25 is a selective, non-immunosuppressive, and potent CypA inhibitor with a structure highly distinct from that of CsA-based inhibitors, showing higher binding affinity, CypA specificity, and stronger anti-PPIase activity compared to those of CsA. It also effectively reduced HCV replication without acute toxicity in vitro and in vivo through the direct inhibition of viral proteins. The combination of the lead 25 with other antiviral agents resulted in a strong synergistic therapeutic activity compared to that of monotherapy or to that of CsA-drug combinations, suggesting the bis-amides as a promising host-targeted anti-HCV agent in the next generation of combinatorial HCV treatments. In order to optimize the lead 25, further structure-activity relationship and docking study of the bis-amides are reported this year [2]. The new bis-amide 7e is demonstrated to generate hydrophobic interaction with the gatekeeper pocket of CypA protein, thus suggesting its potential as a selective CypA inhibitor that can be used as an alternative anti-HCV agent in combinational therapy in the future.<p></p>

<em>I asked, and then, I saw it come true<br>
I sought, and then, I found His ways too<br>
I knocked, and He opened, wide the door<br>
My Lord, My God, I couldn’t ask for more, proof of His Love</em></center>Prayer is a very important feature in the Christian religion. It is a powerful act and gesture that presents one’s own personal connection and faith towards a higher spiritual being. In Christianity, that higher spiritual being is God alone. As the highest and only true deity, God is the answer to our prayers. He answers when we seek for Him. He answers when we have questions about certain things. He answers when we are placed in challenges, doubt, and hardships. Regardless of anything, God is the answer to everything! And he most definitely gives us the accurate and right answer. There is no question about that. Matthew 7:7, 11 states:<br>
“Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”<br>
During this afternoon’s Noon Day Prayer, the AUHS family gathered in fellowship altogether to pray for the well-being of the AUHS community, campus, and the all-around public. The unfortunate event of the COVID-19 pandemic is still among us, but we should not allow that to hinder our personal connections and faith with God. Nor shall we allow any negative aspect in life hinder that spiritual relationship. Always remember that God is there to provide you with a solution, no matter how difficult the situation may be.<p></p>
<p>May God Bless You All.</p>

 Preventive Measures Against Covid-19: Implementation of The-Stay-at-Home Order for the Homeless Population in California and the Permanent NOAH Project,https://news.auhs.edu/preventive-measures-against-covid-19-implementation-of-the-stay-at-home-order-for-the-homeless-population-in-california-and-the-permanent-noah-project/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article819-600x403.png,Articles,"<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article819.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-17628 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article819-300x169.png"" alt="""" width=""620"" height=""349""></a><br>
<strong>Author:</strong> Dr. Albert Ngo<br>
Covid-19 is a respiratory infectious disease caused by SAR-COV-2. Currently, there has not been any vaccine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to provide immunity against the easily and sustainable spread of the infectious virus in the community. Infection occurs by closed contact with an infected person by mouth, nose, and eyes according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A stay-at-home order is implemented by 42 states in the U.S. as a crucial and effective method to controlling the spread of the SAR-COV-2 virus. For instance, of the state, California (CA) is the first state to implement the safer at home order. However, this order is not easy to implement because there is a huge number of homeless people in CA who lack permanent shelters. Homeless people include individuals whose primary residence during the night is a supervised public or private facility (e.g., shelters) that provides temporary living accommodations, and transitional housing.<br>
This study discusses the implementation of the stay-at-home order, also known as safer-at-home to the homeless population living in CA. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there were approximately 151,000 homeless people in the state of California. Challenges to implement the safer-at-home order health, comprises of health education limitations, immigration, and housing issues for the unsheltered and vulnerable homeless population.<br>
One immediate solution implemented is the acquisition of immediate urgent shelter for this vulnerable population. In addition, the city granted three months of protection against the eviction from the tenant’s failure to pay his or her rent due to job loss. Furthermore, the state of CA leases motel rooms to accommodate the homeless and get them out of the street while providing health support for those who are infected with Covid-19.<br>
These programs are indeed very important to abide to the “safer-at-home” order and will be efficient in a short-term run. However, since the pandemic will go beyond three months, it will be challenging and a financial burden for the state of California. One sustainable solution is to provide affordable permanent housing for everyone which could be called, No One-Left-Behind Affordable Housing (NOAH) project, which is an income based permanent housing plan that is accessible and readily available to all type of incomes in the state of California.</p>

 Telehealth Activities in the School of Pharmacy,https://news.auhs.edu/telehealth-activities-in-the-school-of-pharmacy/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-600x403.png,Articles,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-17624 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article818-236x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""893"" height=""1135""><br>
Title: Telehealth Activities in the School of Pharmacy<br>
Author: Dr. Sara Kim</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
With the recent events in regard to COVID-19, many schools switched to online education and moved away from traditional face-to-face classroom teaching by default. Many pharmacy schools adopted an online platform which allowed distant lecturing and learning. However, the use of an online platform was limited to carry out a meaningful co-curricular activity, especially when it comes to patient care activities which required seeing patients. To meet the increasing need of clinical experiences for pharmacy students, the co-curricular committee (CCC) at American University Health Sciences School of Pharmacy have developed a list of virtual activities to fulfill P1 student requirement of Standards 3 and 4 with corresponding assessment tools to ensure the effectiveness of each of the activities. One of the virtual activities that fulfilled patient care was a Tele Brown Bag event. Traditionally, students would visit a nursing facility or senior apartments to review patients’ home medications and provide counseling by checking for appropriate indication, dose, route, frequency, and drug-drug interaction. The CCC implemented a telehealth service to the patient by participating in a virtual home visit by calling the patient. The students were asked to provide the consultation and continual care as well as address any issues or concerns by the community. Upon the interview, we found out that many of the patients were concerned with contracting the virus when going to the pharmacy. The students made handouts to educate patients on how to receive pharmacy services such as receiving a 90-day refill, and delivery services to minimize potential exposure to the virus.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong><br>
The interview was done on June 18th to June 20th, 2020 with the patients selected as residents of Living Opportunities Management Company (LOMCO) in Long Beach, California. Students received an average of three patients to call in order to do a medication review with supervision with at least one faculty. Both students and faculty received a brief orientation before dispersing to make phone calls. If the patient did not pick up a call after a third trial, the student tried calling the next day and if the patient fails to pick up the next day, the student will drop the case. Each student was able to get in touch with at least one patient. Before the interview, students and the residents filled out a pre-event survey and the post-survey after the interview. During the phone call, students went over a two-way verification asking for their name, birthday, medication name, dose, route, frequency, indication, and any experienced side effect. After going over each medication, if adjustment was necessary, students consulted the preceptor and made appropriate recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong><br>
Most students truly appreciated this opportunity to be exposed to patient care especially during this time, which may be difficult for students to do any kind of meaningful direct patient care. This experience also has enhanced their understanding in telehealth and the role of a pharmacist in clinical service during an emergency situation. Also, they developed a communication skill with emphasis in expressing empathy toward patients. By comparing the pre-activity survey and post-activity survey, we were able to find out that students became more aware of their individual level of empathy skills. It was interesting to find out that students scored lower post-survey on the Likert scale (1 indicating strongly disagree and 5 indicating strongly agree) on the question, “It is very easy for me to perceive how the other person is feeling without asking them.” Some possible reasons to this change can be explained by students overestimating their empathy skills. Other comments we received were:<br>
1. The most helpful part would be the experience. I came in thinking it would be straight forward but that is not the case. You have to gently guide them back on topic so that you can answer all the questions that you have for the patient. It definitely will take more practice so that the interview can be smoother and more efficient.<br>
2. The patient interaction was the most helpful part to me. Another part that was very helpful was that I got to learn about side effects and patient medication adherence.<br>
3. It is hard to understand the patient because they go off-topic a lot when you ask them a specific question. It took a lot longer because the patient couldn’t focus on my questions, but eventually she did.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
The telehealth brown bag activity gave unique opportunities to practice skills such as empathy skills that are essential to achieve the learning outcomes within nontraditional classrooms or clinical settings.</p>

<p>We are no strangers to failure and times of hardship. Life throws many curveballs along the way and those curveballs can arrive unexpectedly in the most negative light. In result, we also often find ourselves alone and isolated with our own thoughts while pushing others away from us. However, when we are enclosed and trapped in this deep pit of despair and hopelessness, that is when we have to look up and seek our Heavenly Father for guidance and direction. During this morning’s Morning Dew, AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that when we find ourselves situated in a deep pit, there is no other direction but to look up. Even as the pit becomes deeper and deeper, we have no other choice BUT to look up. And where we look up is where God is. He is looking down at us with His hand reached out to us, so that we may escape the pit that is causing us despair and hopelessness. Genesis 50:20 states:<br>
“But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive.”<br>
So, let this statement become engraved and preserved in your hearts. God will most definitely help us get out of that pit. There is no doubt about it. By doing so, we have to continually look up and see Him to believe.<br>
May God Bless You All ~<br>

<p>The argument over face masks has been with us for a long time. Back in 1910, a deadly type of pneumonia broke out in the Chinese city of Manchouli and quickly spread to Harbin. A young Oxford-educated doctor, Wu Lien-Teh, determined that the disease was a new form of Yersinia Pestis, commonly called the plague, that could be spread by aerosols or sputum. A French doctor, Gérald Mesny, challenged Dr. Wu’s conclusion. Although Dr. Wu had introduced face masks to slow the spread of the plague, Dr. Mesny refused to wear a mask, while investigating the disease. As a result, Dr. Mesny died from the plague. Dr. Wu went on to be the first Chinese doctor to be nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine.1</p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis published in The Lancet has estimated the close contact transmission rate for COVID-19 to be about 17%. Use of a face mask can reduce the transmission rate to 3%.2</p>

<em>Be not troubled by the words that come<br>
From others to make you doubt The Son<br>
Be not worried even when they seek to do harm<br>
Know that God has mighty arm</em></p>
<p>Where there are believers, there are non-believers who oppose and reject God and His Word. In Biblical times, this opposition and rejection emulated in the form of verbal slander and/or even physical corporal punishment that led to death. Nowadays, people who oppose or reject God and His Word criticize believers by pointing their finger and berating them incessantly. And with the use of social media platforms being so widely prevalent, it makes it easier for people to openly criticize and humiliate those who do not share the similar beliefs as they do. Despite all of these hurdles, as children and believers in the Lord God, we must not pay attention towards what naysayers say about us. Instead, we must focus on what we are doing and what our mission is right now: serving God, preaching His Word, and living through His ways of life. John 14:1 states:<br>
“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.”<br>
These inopportune and unfortunate situations are just mere distractions. We, as sons and daughters of God, have more important priorities to focus on than focusing on what others have to say about us. Stones of verbal criticism and slander may be hurled at us but instead of hurling them right back, collect them all and build a strong empire to strengthen the will of God and our hearts. AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that by maintaining and building up our faith and belief in God, we will not be shaken by others and their negativity. We just have to put our faith and hearts in the Heavenly Father and B-E-L-I-E-V-E.<br>

 Recalls for NDMA Impurities,https://news.auhs.edu/recalls-for-ndma-impurities/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/article813-300x212-1.png,Articles,"<p>Author: Dr. Young Il Chang<br>
Several companies have initiated recalls of metformin extended-release (ER) tablets due to the possibility of unacceptable levels of N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potential human carcinogen. NDMA, also known as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), is an organic compound, a volatile yellow oil, which has attracted wide attention due to the high hepatotoxicity and causes liver cancer with chronic exposure in lab animals. In fact, other than the contamination in medications, NDMA is also found in drinking water, cured meat products and can also be formed endogenously following consumption of nitrate-containing food items. For drinking water, it is produced as a byproduct of the water treatment. The acceptable level in California is 10 nanograms per liter in drinking water, but the concern is that it is not readily detectable in this minute concentration and also hard to remove technically.<br>
NDMA was one of several nitrosamine impurities implicated in the recent massive recall of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), as well as the commonly used H2 antagonists, ranitidine and nizatidine. The recall of variety of valsartan containing products in 2018 was the first instance of a product recall being initiated on the basis of an N-nitroso impurity. The reason for the contamination for valsartan products was considered to be the changes in the synthetic process, which initiated investigation of all -sartans and drugs that may have similar structures or processes. More recently, in April 2020, the FDA required the removal of all ranitidine products from the market after it was discovered that NDMA levels could increase over time under normal storage conditions and that higher levels were associated with the length of time since the product was manufactured. In addition, NDMA was found to increase significantly in ranitidine samples stored at higher temperatures.<br>
According to the FDA, patients who take a drug that contains nitrosamine impurities at or below acceptable daily intake levels (96 nanograms per day) are not expected to be at an increased risk of cancer, even if the drug is ingested daily for 70 years. However, the risk may be increased in individuals who are exposed to it above acceptable levels and for long periods of time. For recent metformin ER contamination, the FDA provides laboratory test results (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/laboratory-tests-metformin) and is recommending companies recall lots with levels of NDMA above the acceptable intake limit of 96 nanograms per day.<br>
At this time, the Agency recommends that healthcare professionals continue to prescribe metformin when clinically indicated. Patients should also continue taking metformin ER until advised by their healthcare provider about an alternative treatment option. The immediate-release formulation of metformin has not been found to contain NDMA based on FDA testing. For consumers who are taking the drugs with potential NDMA contaminations, keeping the medication in a storage condition as recommended and consuming it within the expiration date are important to reduce the unnecessary exposure to NDMA.<br>

Those quickly, unguarded words that fall<br>
They run, turn, to injure and collect<br>
The warmth, once caring, abrupt regrets</em></center>Words contain such powerful and impactful meaning. While words can generate immense feelings of positivity, they can also generate toxic slander that is capable of potentially hurting others. Mankind tend to portray an impulsive nature. We will sometimes, if not mostly, act or say something impulsively without pondering or considering about how others may react or feel to our actions. If we are exposed and vulnerable to words that are hurtful and cause unnecessary emotional damage, we must not lash out or become vengeful in return. Instead, we must channel those emotions through God’s love and blessing that will calm us and bring us back together. James 1:19 states:<br>
“My beloved brothers, understand this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.”<br>
It is in this verse what God wants from us when we are experiencing situations that involve gossip, betrayal, distrust, and anger. In order for us to resolve those differences, we have to stop ourselves and think about our actions and perhaps, even consider what the opposed side is going through. That side may be experiencing something that is negative, to the point where they are targeting others for their own selfish gratitude. We must never fall into Satan’s trap of generating toxic slander and rumors that will hurt others. Because in the end, you are standing with God, by God, and for God.<br>

 The History of Handwashing in Medical Sciences: Relevance to COVID-19,https://news.auhs.edu/the-history-of-handwashing-in-medical-sciences-relevance-to-covid-19/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-1.png,Articles,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The History of Handwashing in Medical Sciences: Relevance to COVID-19</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Sandor Szabo, M.D., Ph.D., MPH</em><br>
Professor, American University of Health Sciences, Signal Hill/Long Beach, CA<br>
Visiting Professor, Semmelweis University Medical School, Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p>We often take for granted that a simple preventive measure such as handwashing has been around for a long time. Unfortunately, that is not the case – since this has been implemented only about 170 years ago, the aftermath was a huge debate and controversy that pushed the inventing physician into an asylum where he died without any recognition.<br>
Today, the acknowledged “inventor” of handwashing is the young Hungarian physician Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis who, while working at a university hospital in Vienna, Austria, introduced handwashing against the resistance of his senior colleagues during the middle of the 19th century. Namely, he noticed that young doctors and medical students arrived after performing an autopsy with bare hands – since no gloves were available at that time – of which deceased patients (at that time, an autopsy was required virtually on all deaths) and assisted in delivering newborn infants, the young mothers often contracted “puerperal sepsis” and died – but not after Dr. Semmelweis introduced handwashing. Nevertheless, his seniors were still not convinced and placed him in a mental asylum where he died. Nowadays, a medical museum and a university medical school in Budapest are named after him.<br>

<p>Let us fast-forward to the COVID-19 pandemic: A recent front-page article titled, “Unwitting hand in a sanitizer legend” in the Sunday edition of the Los Angeles Times described a similar story from the middle of the 20th century. In 1966, a student nurse named Lupe Hernandez from Bakersfield, California began to use hand sanitizers because of the “lack of soap and hot water,” In doing so, Hernandez supposedly developed hand sanitizer by mixing liquid soap with alcohol and other chemicals. This legend has many twists and unproven implications, but it is possibly true, i.e. the modern hand sanitizers were apparently invented here in California.<br>
The moral of these stories is that we do not always need modern medicine to control the initial spread of infectious diseases, especially if one has a creative and deductive mind; simple measures such as handwashing will help in the first steps – as in the situation of COVID-19.</p>

<em>I shall offer what I have left<br>
It’s only fitting because I’m kept<br>
By obligations, many you see<br>
As long as I do something, it’s generosity,<br>
Towards God</em></p>
<p>Our God is an Almighty God who sees and knows everything that we do. When we are presenting our offerings to God, these offerings have to be genuine and from the heart. Whether these offerings are monetary, material possessions, or in the form for edible consumption, they have to be wholly and intentionally given from our hearts. For example, if an individual receives a re-gifted item for Christmas and later on discovers that the item was a “hand-me-down”, that individual would obviously feel disappointed and quite frankly, insulted. The reason why is because that individual was not cherished or considered as important. Rather, he or she is regarded as “second-hand” or unimportant. We must not act that way, especially towards our Heavenly Father. Deuteronomy 15:21 states:<br>
“And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God.”<br>
Any gift or offering that has been used, tainted, or previously possessed must not be bestowed towards God. God can never be looked down on, degraded, or insulted. He must also not be ignored or put away to the side for a later time. For everything that He has done for us, we have to give back to God every day. So, take some time to reflect upon yourselves and what you can offer for God. He will always be there for His children through the good and the bad.</p>

<p>Fellowship is an important component in the Christian religion. It is important because it gathers and unites a community of believers together to share their faith and spirituality in the Lord Jesus Christ. A fellowship consisting of brothers and sisters in Christ do not have to solely be within a church. Instead, it can be anywhere. Whether it is leading a Bible study group in the comfort of your own home or even meeting together with other believers to discuss the Word of God at a coffee shop, the unity is still heavily present and active. Matthew 5:6 states:<br>
“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.”<br>
Therefore, it is imperative that we as a community seek God’s blessing and love. As flawed humans, we exhibit a variety of negative emotional aspects, such as arrogance, pride, and selfishness. We have to break down those walls that barricade us from coming forward to God. Without Him, we are nothing and we would not be where we are at today. Keep Him in your heart and mind now, and forever more.</p>

<p>Neonatal abstinence syndrome or neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NAS/NOWS) is a drug withdrawal syndrome in newborns as a result of opioid use during pregnancy. The manifestation of this syndrome is marked by central nervous system irritability, difficulty feeding, respiratory problems, and seizures. Newborns with NAS/NOWS are more likely than other babies to also have low birthweight and respiratory complications. Nationally, there was a five-fold increase in the incidence of NAS in 2014 compared to 2004. However, in California, there is a two-fold increase in the incidence of NAS from 2009-2012 to 2013-2016. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016), contributing factors may include geographic areas, rurality, and availability of care for this particular condition. The cost of hospital stay for a newborn with NAS is nine times that of other newborns and mostly covered by Medicaid, indicating this syndrome to be from lower income communities. According to the CDC, adopted prevention and intervention strategies are prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), education, and proper medical supervision in pregnant women with high relapse rates through collaboration with pediatric care teams, non- pharmacological methods of treatment (rooming-in with mothers after birth, breastfeeding, swaddling, skin-to-skin time and minimizing stimuli in environments), and pharmacological methods through the use of drugs (morphine, methadone, clonidine). Although the efforts are ongoing, social stigma, costs, and legalities are still the barriers that need to be addressed in order to overcome the rising frequency of this syndrome.</p>

<em>As you turn to walk away</em><br>
<em>From those things, you did just yesterday</em><br>
<em>Do not be hurt when former friends speak ill</em><br>
<em>Or spew forth words, former fondness kills</em><br>
<em>For no one can serve God and this world too</em><br>
<em>You belong to God, even when you never knew, separated</em></p>
<p>Society can be very judgmental. From the clothes that we wear to the religion that we identify with, there are moments such as these in which others are very quick to judge based on how we look and how we live our lives. This does not only occur from the outside, but it may also occur within our circle of close friends. In result, this can become an unfortunate situation, but when there is a rift that is caused between choosing God or your friends, choose God above others. Genuine friends will stick by you through thick or thin, even if you sustain and support another religious belief. 1 Peter 4:4 states:</p>
<p>Of course, your former friends are surprised when you no longer plunge into the flood of wild and destructive things they do. So, they slander you.</p>
<p>Former friends turn away because they are not accepting of their companion’s newly restored ways of living and spiritual beliefs. They feel that they have been betrayed by their companion when in actuality, it should not be the case. Instead, that companion who turned his or her life around for God should be an ultimate blessing. God warmly welcomes everyone with open arms. However, when there are those who reject His Word and stray away from God’s unconditional love, then they are separating themselves from God, not for God.</p>

<p>There are many materialistic items that we desire. Whether it is a house, a new car, the latest piece of clothing, or the most popular smartphone out on the market, there is no doubt that we want to fulfill our “wish list” for these types of items. However, there are other concepts of desiring something, such as earning more money so that we can put food on the table and feed our children, or to pay bills. While all of these forms of desire may or may not occur at an instant moment, we do know, however, that God will fulfill our desires when He decides that the time is right. That is His promise to us. Proverbs 3:5-6 states:</p>
<p><em>Trust in the Lord with your heart</em><br>
<em>And lean not on your own understanding</em><br>
<em>In all your ways acknowledge Him</em><br>
<em>And He will make your paths straight</em></p>
<p>And so, let this be. Look forward to God when trials, tribulations, or challenges happen. Even if you are not desiring something, just reach out to God anyway if you are pondering or going through an unfortunate situation that is creating an obstacle in your life. God is always listening and there for you and will give you a sign that is coming your way when your time arrives in order to be fulfilled.<br>

<h2>Highlighting the Impact of COVID-19 Infections on Older Adults in the United States</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Lee Meyer</strong><br>
Older adults in the United States are a high-risk group for acquiring the COVID-19 coronavirus and experiencing the greatest impact in morbidity and mortality. For people over sixty-five years of age in the United States, the statistical data are very different than the data familiar to most people and reported in the news each day.</p>
<p><strong>Morbidity and Mortality</strong><br>
At the time of this article, the total known cases around the world are approaching 17 million total cases and over 661,000 deaths. In the United States (2019 population of 328.2 million), the total number of known cases is approaching 4.5 million cases (1.4% of the population) and 150,000 deaths. The ratios of deaths to total cases are 3.8% and 3.3% respectively. How does the numbers for the elderly in the U.S. compare to this view of all ages?</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone wp-image-17503"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a2-300x170.png"" alt="""" width=""383"" height=""217""><img loading=""lazy"" class="" wp-image-17504 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a1-300x169.png"" alt="""" width=""369"" height=""208""></p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC’s) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Reporting System shows a disproportional hospitalization rate for increasing age groups with the rates for adults increasing roughly 150% for each 10-year age group starting at 18 years old. Hospitalizations per 100,000 population (infected or not) among those 65 – 74 years old are nearly 200 (2%), for those 75 – 84 years old are about 330 (3.3%) and 513 (5.1%) for those 85 years and older.<br>
Of the deaths related to COVID-19 alone, 80% of those individuals have been over 65 years of age. The deaths of residents in nursing homes represent over 50% of the total deaths per state in 10 of the 50 states. That population is enumerated by the CDC: in the U.S. in 2016, the CDC recorded 15,600 nursing homes (skilled nursing facilities) with 1.7 million beds (average: ~108 residents per facility).<br>
Social and Lifestyle Impact<br>
The precautions recommended by the CDC include masking and social distancing. For older adults in licensed health facilities and in licensed residential facilities (e.g. assisted living), those common precautions translate to prohibiting in-person visitors, even family.<br>
The treasured moments and experiences of being retired – being a grandparent, starting new ventures, traveling, diving into lifelong hobbies and interests are all on hold for those otherwise healthy seniors. Those older adults in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities (as well as other group-living situations) are unable to experience the simple joys of in-person visits, holding hands, and from family, friends and even spouses. Protecting others is a key concept behind the wearing of masks, social distancing, and hand washing. Older adults may benefit the most from the vigilance and attention paid by all of us to these simple and effective preventative measures.</p>

 Protect your friends,https://news.auhs.edu/protect-your-friends/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-2.png,Morning Too,"<h3><img loading=""lazy"" class="" wp-image-17498 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/morning-dew-731-300x165.jpg"" alt="""" width=""478"" height=""263""></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Protect Your Friends</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Give no place to any voice that tears</em><br>
<em>Or tries to destroy us with gossip and fear</em><br>
<em>Protect your allies, your comrades in arms</em><br>
<em>To entertain division brings nothing but harm</em></p>
<p>Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. While this statement is not exactly implying to keep your enemies closer than your friends, it is implying that one should keep a sharp, watchful eye on the enemy in order to protect friends, family, and other loved ones. If we fail to catch the enemy in the act or if we are ignorant of the wicked comments, rumors, or slander that is spewed out from the enemy, then division will occur. Thus, that togetherness, that unity, that bond is broken and cannot be mended back immediately. Satan is always looking for ways to break that connection between our relationship with God and with our fellow loved ones. He slithers in darkness and is ready to strike but is unwilling to emerge out into the light where honesty, love, strength, and other positive factors are present. Proverbs 16:28 states:<br>
A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.<br>
That whisperer is Satan. In the Garden of Eden, Satan, commonly portrayed as a serpent, tempts Eve in which she does fall under temptation and is banished from the Garden along with Adam, who was warned by God not to eat the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. When the fruit was consumed, the bond between God and Adam and Eve became broken, which resulted in their banishment from the Garden of Eden. This morning, AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that it is highly important to protect your loved ones and to look out for them. If someone else is spewing out falsified information about your loved ones, stand up for them. Do not fall under their dark shadows, for they are the ones trying to divide that beloved bond.<br>

 Unity in Our Diversity,https://news.auhs.edu/unity-in-our-diversity/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled.png,Noonday Prayer,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class="" wp-image-17495 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noon-prayer-7-29-300x197.jpg"" alt="""" width=""469"" height=""308""></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Unity in Our Diversity</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>We are each gifted and each unique</em><br>
<em>Still in our variations seek</em><br>
<em>The whole, do good, know relevance</em><br>
<em>Serving God by the sacrament</em><br>
<em>Lest anyone try to subjugate</em><br>
<em>We hold fast this love and dedicate</em><br>
<em>Ourselves to Unity</em></p>
<p>A family or a team sticks together through thick and thin. When times are tough and when we are put down or being criticized by others, we have to bring each other up to keep going on. This is what defines unity. The infamous quote come to mind when the topic of unity is being discussed: “Stick and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.” Chastising another individual out of jealousy or frustration channels nothing but emotional hurt and pain from that individual. So, why do we do it? We usually take this out of context to bring ourselves up instead. By putting someone else down, there is the notion that our confidence and self-esteem will grow out of selfish gain. Therefore, we should not adhere to such an approach. 1 Corinthians 12:12 states:<br>
Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body – whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free – and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.<br>
We hail from various backgrounds and cultures all around the world. While our practices and skin color are different, our faith and unity in God the Father shouldn’t be. AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that despite our differences and imperfections, we should continue to unite together and lift each other up to perform our daily duties in honor of the Heavenly Father.<br>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Never Will He Leave You</span></p>
<p><em>Whilst the battle rages and you feel done</em><br>
<em>Though all have left, and in your tent there’s none</em><br>
<em>The Lord above sits there with you</em><br>
<em>To remind you of, what you once knew</em><br>
<em>You are not alone</em></p>
<p>We often turn to our peers for advice and solace when we are enduring challenging situations. But, how often do we seek God when these situations come up? We find ways to reach out to our family or friends for comfort and support but when we are approached with the suggestion of reaching out to God, we revert ourselves back and are hesitant to do so. Why is this the case? Perhaps there are several reasons, such as the uncertainty that a higher spiritual being will not fully understand what an individual is going through. Or it may be the stubborn belief that we will be able to conquer these obstacles ourselves instead of seeking guidance or receiving any form of answer or advice. God is there for us for many reasons. But, among these many reasons are that God wants us, His children, to come forward to him when we are searching for a solution. Joshua 1:9 states:</p>
<p><em>Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.</em></p>
<p>Isolation can be perceived from a negative context. However, when it comes to isolating yourself with God, that is an ideal time to spend your personal, one-on-one time with Him. During this morning’s Morning Dew prayer service, AUHS President Dr. Caroll Ryan stated that your personal time with God presents a distinct and pivotal moment with the Heavenly Father, as this is more directed and intimate which will allow Him to help and guide you along the way. So, remember, do not be afraid or hesitant to approach God and spend personal time with Him. He is always there to listen, and He will always be there to provide you with a definite answer.</p>

 Desires of the Heart,https://news.auhs.edu/desires_of_the_heart/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Untitled-1.png,Morning Dew,"<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/We-need-God.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16974 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/We-need-God.jpg"" alt="""" width=""324"" height=""210""></a>It is very common for mankind to suppress their emotions and thoughts. At times, we become too prideful or reluctant to seek guidance and advice because we believe that we can resolve our own issues. But we can only hold in so much that when our emotions and thoughts gradually bottle up overtime, it can explode and spill out. The results may not even be a positively favorable one as well. Thus, during these times of challenges and questioning, we turn towards God for a certain answer. It is only in Him that He can offer us the answer or solution that we are looking for. Psalm 81:10 says:</p>
<p><em>I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it.</em></p>
<p>On this beautiful Monday morning, AUHS Founder Pastor Gregory Johnson stated that we must consume and nourish our bodies with God’s love and word. While this is not an exact and literal portrayal, this depiction is indeed a true and effective one. Only can we become blessed with the word from the Heavenly Father that we can do all things through Him and Him alone.</p>

 The Actuality of the Prescription Drug Expenditures in the U.S.,https://news.auhs.edu/the_actuality_of_the_prescription_drug_expenditure_in_the_us/,,Articles,"<p><em>By June Kim, PharmD, MBA</em><br>
Assistant Professor, Department of Clinical &amp; Administrative Sciences,&nbsp;School of Pharmacy</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Prescription-Drugs-e1594612550286.jpeg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-16887 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Prescription-Drugs-e1594612550286.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""467"" height=""263""></a>The increasing cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. warrants a reform in order to lighten the financial burdens on the patients or the insured.</p>
<p>The prescription drug expenditures in the U.S. were 360.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 with a steady increasing trend in annual historic records since 2005, and there has been a collective call from the public for a change in the skyrocketing levels of spending in prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Utilization and a unit cost seem to be the main areas that need to be carefully examined for any change. Increased utilization of drugs primarily results from the FDA approval process for brand and generic drugs, which is costly due to the multiple phase process.&nbsp;Overutilization related to a fee-for-service system and to patients’ preferences on drug advertisements without adequate drug information can be other factors to be considered for drug utilization. Cost per unit for drugs, especially for brand drugs, is remarkably high concerning the exclusive period.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to address the rising costs of pharmaceuticals by the policy makers at the federal level. Expediting the FDA’s drug approval process and eliminating industrial practices that discourage generic utilization can substantially alleviate the severity of the issue. Government involvement in Medicare Part D for price negotiation can also significantly help lower the costs.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is partially, if not mostly, responsible for the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. by granting drug companies an enormous power for price negotiation. The U.S. policy makers should step out of the pharmaceutical lobbying network and take appropriate regulatory actions to make adjustments on the monopolistic culture of the pharmaceutical industry, which has been deeply rooted in the country.</p>

While there are common methods for instigating change, such as peaceful protests and council meetings, many others in the community are creating and providing a visual voice and message through their artworks.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that Hannah Stahulak has learned, it is that radical change is possible. As an artist who is currently based in the heart of Los Angeles, she was recently inspired by the fight for social and racial justice. In light of these civil issues, Ms. Stahulak has decided to develop an art project that is based on donations. All of the donation proceeds will be going towards the Black Lives Matter chapter in Los Angeles. She generated her pieces of artwork back in 2015 as a conceptual idea of constructing a fragmented body of artwork together. While the drawings function as individual pieces or as a collective whole, they work together in a similar way that fighting for racial justice works, as it takes individuals to empathize and understand other people’s perspectives. Ms. Stahulak believes that in unity, we can create change as a collective whole.</p>

As a diversity-driven minority-based school, the AUHS community firmly and proudly stands with Ms. Stahulak’s beliefs in the fight for racial equality and justice.</p>

Humankind is at a civil war against each other. While there have been numerous protests fighting for the rights of equal and fair treatment of minority groups, the portrayal of racial tension and division is still heavily evident to this day. With these tragic and unfortunate situations seen through the lens of the public media, these unforeseen events define a cycle of hostility and bigotry that must be broken. In result, we must continue to make progress in ending racial intolerance and xenophobia by being open-minded and empathetic. At American University of Health Sciences, we are a minority-serving, faith-based, for-profit health university located in Southern California. Our mission to promote communal and student diversity is one of our top priorities, as we believe that underrepresented students deserve an equal opportunity for higher education.</p>

 Older Adults May Add More Challenges to the Detection of COVID-19,https://news.auhs.edu/older_adults_may_add_more_challenges_to_the_detection_of_covid19/,,Articles,"<p><em>By Dr. Lee Meyers</em><br>
<em>Assistant Professor of Clinical and Administrative Sciences</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-19-elderly-e1594080971180.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-16855 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-19-elderly-e1594080971180.jpg"" alt="""" width=""507"" height=""270""></a>By now, many healthcare professionals are keenly aware of the most general symptoms of COVID-19, as stated by the World Health Organization. These symptoms include fever, insistent dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. While these are common signs, there are also more serious symptoms of the virus such as difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, and the loss of speech and movement.</p>
<p>In addition, less common symptoms are becoming more familiar: chills, aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on the skin, and the discoloration of fingers or toes. It currently seems that older adults may present a much different list of COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, it is possibly well-known that older adults demonstrate symptoms of diseases differently than younger adults, and this may again be the case with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>According to anecdotal reports written by geriatricians in a recent Kaiser Health News article, the typical signs of infection with the coronavirus may not be completely present in older adults who test positive for the disease. Vital signs may even appear normal, which consequently leads to a missed diagnosis. On the other hand, if left unrecognized and untreated, senior citizens are more prone to suffer from a series of events that can ultimately lead to a diagnosis of the coronavirus. This is because they find themselves in the hospital for a traumatic event and are later on tested for the virus. In further detail, senior citizens may fail to remain hydrated or fed, suffer a fall, become hospitalized, and even risk for being tested as positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>An early onset or sign that senior citizens may experience is if they are simply not exhibiting normal behavior. An example would be family members or caregivers reporting that the senior citizen may need more sleep or has a loss of appetite. Others may seem unusually apathetic, confused, dizzy, or lose orientation around their surroundings. Furthermore, the presence of other chronic diseases may confound or mask signs and symptoms of an infection, impair the individual’s ability to report, or even experience additional symptoms. Their symptoms may even appear to be in the form of another condition. At first, what might seem to be a cognitive disorder is in fact, the manifestation of a functional decline that initially begins with the coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>While anecdotal cases continue to be reported by geriatricians around the United States, data is being collected from hospitals and nursing homes in Europe as well. Much more must be learned on how and why the coronavirus is present in the elderly. Complicating factors in physiology, lifestyle, co-morbidities, and the psychosocial realm can significantly impact the sequence of events in the infectious process.</p>

 Structure-Based Design of Nicotinamides as a Novel Class of Androgen Receptor Antagonists for Prostate Cancer,https://news.auhs.edu/structure_based_design_of_nicotinamides_as_-a_novel_class_of_androgen_receptor_antagonists_for_prostate_cancer/,,Articles,"<p><em>By: Suhui Yang, PhD</em><br>
<em>Assistant Professor, School of Pharmacy</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAR-Istructural.image1_-e1593535549332.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16810 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAR-Istructural.image1_-e1593535549332.png"" alt="""" width=""883"" height=""350""></a>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United States. Antiandrogen therapy with first-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonists, such as bicalutamide (BIC), leads to a temporary reduction of prostate cancer with a decrease in the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker of prostate cancer. Unfortunately, cancer cells grow again in the absence of androgens and progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is attributed to elevated AR gene expression which can be driven by AR gene amplification, AR gene mutation, or ligand-independent AR activation. In addition, the first-generation AR antagonists acquire agonistic property in cells that are engineered to express higher amounts of AR. This switch from antagonism to partial agonism is demonstrated by the anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome; the serum concentration of PSA decreases in patients after discontinuation of anti-androgens.</p>
<p>There have been extensive studies to develop pure AR antagonists. However, due to the lack of structural information of AR in the antagonistic mode, the chemical modification on either agonists or first-generation antagonists of AR has been mainly applied. To address the issue of a possible switch from AR antagonist to agonist inducers by structural similarity, the research group that Dr. Yang worked in performed receptor-based virtual screenings (VS) to identify a totally new chemical scaffold, the nicotinamide DIMN (Figure) [1]. DIMN has been proven to be more potent than the current drug, BIC, and to significantly reduce cell growth of both the early and late stages of prostate cancer. Moreover, the nicotinamide DIMN has never been exposed in the literature with any biological activity, and this is the first successful attempt to apply VS for a lead identification by using AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) in the agonistic mode.</p>
<p>Further structural optimization on the lead DIMN based on a structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis successfully leads to more potent nicotinamide compounds containing alkoxy substituents at positions of 5 or 6 of the isoquinoline [2]. This strong antiandrogenic effect of the nicotinamides would be well explained by their AR binding affinity as well as the potent inhibition effect on AR activation steps. In addition, encouragingly, the assumption of the nicotinamides retaining strong AR antagonism seems to be clarified as the alkoxy substituents of the isoquinoline moiety, which are closely packed in the pocket and located within just a short distance, causing a dislocation of Met895. In result, it leads to the impairment in the reposition of mobile carboxyl-terminal H12 and the consequent disruption of AF2 formation. All these findings highlight the nicotinamide nucleus containing alkoxy groups on isoquinoline as an excellent scaffold for a novel class of AR antagonists. The provided SAR data and docking models can offer a useful guidance for the designing of pure AR antagonists as effective therapeutic agents for advanced prostate cancer.</p>

 Repentance,https://news.auhs.edu/repentance/,https://news.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled.png,Morning Dew,"<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Repentance-e1593473011768.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft wp-image-16803"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Repentance-300x160.jpg"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""213""></a>Sin is an action that we perform on a daily basis. At times, we are unaware of committing these sins and continue to do so because of sheer ignorance. This is an unhealthy and toxic cycle that we have to break away from and cease completely. We cannot keep overriding our sinful habits because, in result, we become accustomed to and ingrained with it. No matter how minuscule or serious it may be, a sin is a sin. No matter what. Stealing a mere penny off of the floor, for instance, can gradually lead to stealing larger amounts of money from innocent people. Greed and temptation eventually set in. This behavior and mindset are highly immoral and unacceptable. Therefore, to turn away from our sins and transgressions, we must come forward, surrender, and repent to our Heavenly Father. Ezekiel 18:30 states that:</p>
<p><em>“Therefore I will judge you. O house of Israel, everyone according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so, iniquity shall not be your ruin.”</em></p>
<p>We must not take our Lord God for granted. He is an almighty Father who loves His children unconditionally. He is present at all times in order for us to seek help and guidance from Him. The act of repentance aligns with cleansing and purifying ourselves from our wrongdoings and should be initiated and incorporated throughout our lives.</p>

 COVID-19: A Brief Overview,https://news.auhs.edu/covid-19_a_brief_overview/,,Articles,"<p><em>By: Balwantsinh Chauhan, MD, PhD</em><br>
<em>Associate Professor, School of Pharmacy</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cornovirius-e1593467745658.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16799 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cornovirius-e1593467745658.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""226""></a>Coronaviruses are introduced as a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electrographs create an image that resembles the solar corona. In result, they derived their name “CORONA-VIRUSES.” The meaning of <em>corona</em> in Latin is defined as ‘crown’ or ‘wreath.’ Currently, there are three known types of coronaviruses. The first type is SARS-CoV, which is mainly responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2002, SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome – Corona Virus) originated from an animal reservoir, primarily in bats. The source of this reservoir eventually mutated onto the civet, which later transmitted onto humans. The second type is the Middle Eastern Respiratory Distress Syndrome or MERS-CoV, which also originated from an animal reservoir, the bat. This reservoir also mutated onto the camel, which eventually transmitted towards humans. Finally, in 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, otherwise known as SARS-CoV-2 or Corona Virus Disease-19 retains the source of the reservoir from a bat. The source of the reservoir mutates onto the pangolin and later to humans. The virus mutates by ‘homologous recombination’, i.e. swamping of genetic material.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 213 countries and territories with a reported total of 9,754,573 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Although there have been many challenges and consequences in these unfortunate cases, medical/health professionals and disease specialists are uniting and compromising together to make progress. American University of Health Sciences is proud of its board of certified and licensed faculty members for their professional expertise in researching the virus.</p>

 Teaching and Learning In A Social Distancing Environment,https://news.auhs.edu/teaching_and_learning_in_a_social_distancing_environment/,,Articles,"<p><em>By:&nbsp;</em><em>Jonathan Sheng, PhD</em><br>
<em>Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/distance-learning-e1592935034705.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16774 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/distance-learning-e1592935034705.jpg"" alt="""" width=""661"" height=""400""></a>The recent COVID-19 event has posed great challenges to both university professors and students, as almost all teaching/learning activities are moved from traditional classrooms to online platforms.&nbsp; Consequently, many course instructors have quickly made changes on their originally planned teaching strategies and materials to embrace the changing teaching environment in order to maintain their teaching effectiveness and efficiency, while students also promptly and accordingly adjusted their learning strategies and methods to adapt the changing learning environment in order to overcome the resulting academic difficulties.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages of teaching/learning on-line compared to that in traditional classrooms. The main advantages of on-line teaching/learning are: (1). There are no geographic restrictions. Instructors can teach online courses from London or Tokyo and students can take on-line classes in North Carolina or Texas. (2). On-line classes are more cost-effective. For example, during the past few weeks of social distancing implementation, both students and faculty have saved money on the cost of commuting to campus and family caring as a result of working from home. Meanwhile, the working environment on campus has also become much more comfortable with just 5-6 remaining faculty members sharing an entire office building.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of online teaching/learning are that students are unable to engage in hands-on learning activities and unable to participate in group-learning activities in person.&nbsp; Learning is a social activity and the in-person interactions between students and instructors or among fellow classmates are indispensable.&nbsp; It is often better for students to learn through hands-on experience rather than by being lectured remotely.</p>
<p>The learning styles of students are diverse. There are verbal learners who benefit from textbook reading or being lectured by instructors with visual or aural aids, while there are also tactile or kinesthetic learners who prefer to learn new materials in a lab setting where they can gain physical hands-on experiences.&nbsp; Some students (social learners) prefer to study by group, while others (solitary learners) prefer to study alone.</p>
<p>Previously Kolb and his coauthor categorized all learning styles into four distinct types: accommodating, assimilating, converging, and diverging.&nbsp; Through their years of empirical studies, these four learning style types have been further refined into a nine-style typology: experiencing, reflecting, thinking, acting, imagining, analyzing, deciding, initiating, and balancing.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of student learning styles, one teaching strategy that faculty may consider is to shift their teaching paradigm from traditional one-size-fits-all teaching approaches to more adaptive and personalized ones. The latter ones fit better to those institutions with low student-to-faculty ratios or smaller classes.</p>
<p>At the American University of Health Sciences, students enjoy a decent student-faculty ratio and a relatively small class size of fewer than 30 enrolled students per class, both in traditional classrooms and at online teaching platforms.&nbsp; With the current social distancing measures, course instructors should think creatively and be willing to try new adaptive teaching approaches. For example, virtual simulations may replicate physical demonstrations in a social distancing environment.</p>
<p>The American University of Health Sciences School of Pharmacy (AUHS-SOP) is a newly established Doctor of Pharmacy program.&nbsp; Its inaugural class has already completed its first year (P1) course work and started its experiencing phase of training.&nbsp; Students at AUHS-SOP have put their efforts into adapting the virtual learning environment resulting from the social distancing implementation.&nbsp; They have not only taken all their courses online but also participated in virtual Interprofessional Education (IPE) simulation training events along with the medical and nursing students and other health-care professionals at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science.&nbsp; The virtual IPE simulation training has provided the participating students with opportunities to bridge their first-year course work to experiential learning.</p>
<p>We all hope the current social distancing measures can be ended soon. But until then our strategies and methods ought to be adjusted accordingly in order to adapt the online classroom only teaching/learning environment.</p>

 How Coronavirus Affects Community Pharmacy Operations,https://news.auhs.edu/how-coronavirus-affects-community-pharmacy-operations/,,Articles,"<p><em>By: Christine Han, Pharm.D</em><br>
<em>Assistant Professor,&nbsp; School of Pharmacy<br>
</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/COVI-D-Pharmacy.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16747 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/COVI-D-Pharmacy.png"" alt="""" width=""565"" height=""351""></a>Commitment to their community drove many pharmacists to go above and beyond their usual standard of service to ensure patients had access to crucial medicines as fear of infection with COVID-19 kept many older patients from leaving home. In other cases, the local pharmacist became the only healthcare professional patients could see in person as clinics and hospitals instituted pandemic precautions.</p>
<p>Many independent pharmacists reported that their pharmacies now delivers 90% of its prescriptions, as many of his patients remain afraid to leave their homes because of COVID-19. That comes to about 150 prescriptions every day.</p>
<p>A survey published by the NCPA June 1 found that 82% of community pharmacists expect to continue expanded home delivery and curbside service.</p>
<p>Community pharmacists also plan to continue other services that they began to offer or enhanced in the last few months.</p>
<p>While three-quarters of the pharmacists surveyed had not provided point-of-care testing prior to the pandemic, 61% anticipated that they and other local pharmacies would test for a variety of illnesses going forward. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services authorized testing for COVID-19 at pharmacies in April, and about 70% of states had changed their regulations to permit testing at pharmacies by early June.</p>
<p>Testing represents just one aspect of the expanded scope of practice pharmacists have seen over the last few months, and many anticipate that they will perform more healthcare services on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Additional services include offering vaccinations, which had been authorized in many states before the pandemic. In 2019, 73% of community pharmacies offered immunizations, but only 25% provided more than the influenza vaccine. When a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is developed, many pharmacists expect to add it to their services. In late May, Minnesota passed the first law in the nation, allowing pharmacists to administer the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine when one is approved.</p>
<p>More than half of respondents to the NCPA survey expected more pharmacies to provide immunizations. This would be a great time to start offering an expanded range of vaccines, as the CDC has reported a sharp drop in immunizations among children during the pandemic.</p>

 Understanding Pharmacogenetics of COVID-19: Role in Potential Magic Bullet Drug,https://news.auhs.edu/understanding-pharmacogenetics-of-covid-19/,,Articles,"<p><em>By: Dr. Sukhwinder Lakhman</em><br>
<em>Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy<br>
</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pharmagogenic.png""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16739 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pharmagogenic-e1592166070800.png"" alt="""" width=""676"" height=""380""></a>Immune responses demonstrate a high level of intra-species variation, compensating for the specialization capacity of pathogens. The recent advent of in-depth immune phenotyping projects in large-scale cohorts has allowed the first look into the factors that shape the inter-individual diversity of the human immune system. Genetic approaches have identified genetic diversity as drivers of 20-40% of the variation between the immune systems of individuals. The remaining 60-80% is shaped by intrinsic factors, with age being the predominant factor, as well as by environmental influences, where cohabitation and chronic viral infections were identified as key mediators. We can review and integrate the recent in-depth large-scale studies on human immune diversity and its potential impact on health.</p>
<p>Genetic variability in the human immune system may affect susceptibility to, and severity of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The research is published in the Journal of Virology in 2020, a publication of the American Society for Microbiology. Genetic variation explains some of the differences in the strength of immune responses. Certain immune system genes code for proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which vary tremendously. These variations influence how well the immune system recognizes a given pathogen or other foreign entity. An HLA type that leads to poor recognition of SARS-CoV-2 could cause a person to be more vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p>“Understanding how variation in HLA&nbsp; may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease,” according to the authors of the new study by Nguyen et al., (2020).</p>
<p>The authors show that individual HLA type likely influences the capacity to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection and note that certain alleles, in particular, could be associated with more severe infection, as has previously been shown with SARS-CoV. “This is the first study to report global distributions of HLA types… with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic,” write the authors, from Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland, and the Portland VA Research.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this is that there may be other genes and the mutations in humans that make some people more resistant to this disease. Uncovering the genetic biomarkers in the human immune response that makes some people resistant to the COVID-19 will be of great interest and will help us understand the underline mechanisms that may help us design a potent drug to control this disease.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kidney-banner-e1591735189521.jpg""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-16717 alignleft"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kidney-banner-e1591735189521.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1000"" height=""333""></a>The post-transplant patients, as you know, need to keep the immune system low with the immunosuppressive medications, and as the pandemic causes more chronic uncertainties, it is causing multi-faced anxiety among the pot-transplant patients. First, the health-related concerns are the major ones. Any symptom which resembles Covid19 symptoms, even the minor ones like muscle pain, can let them worry about the possible infections and spreading the virus to the family members without awareness of it. Also, these individuals are concerned that they will miss any necessary treatments, like a missing dental service for acute tooth pain and concerns about building up the infection that potentially has an adverse impact on their transplant.</p>
<p>The second concerns include the safety and security in treatment and returning to work. The transplant patients need to take life-long immunosuppressive medications, and for several years there was a shortage in generic tacrolimus, one of the major immunosuppressive medications. On top of that, Covid19 caused supply chain instability to raise concerns if other medications also will be on shortage. What about the in-person clinic visit or home/telemedicine visit options, like for a blood draw, for the routine medication level checkup, which both cannot guarantee Covid19 safe procedures. They also concerned about if it is safe for them to go back to work once everything reopens, and how they can address this issue and demonstrate the same value to the company as other co-workers?</p>
<p>Lastly, they are inundated with information floating around which are sometimes conflicting with each other since it is such a new phenomenon. They hear different things from different professionals. So, what they need is a single source of trusted information. CDS guidelines are great, probably, for dialysis patients, but it’s not specific for transplant patients.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"">While we are going through this pandemic with our patients, it’s important to listen to their voices and collaborate to meet their needs. Ideally, we can collaborate to provide trustworthy single-source information for a specific patient group including post-transplant patients.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">IT’S HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">by: Pastor Gregory Johnson</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s hard for me to breathe sometimes<br>
When people look at me<br>
Judge me, value me,<br>
Based upon the color of my skin<br>
As if my color or theirs<br>
Suggests, what is good or bad<br>
Success or failure<br>
Or likelihood to win</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s hard for me to breathe sometimes<br>
When so many say the right thing<br>
Declare they care<br>
Announce their concern<br>
Suggest they are compassionate<br>
But then fling</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cast my liberty<br>
Throw my rights<br>
Lob my freedom<br>
While telling me what to say<br>
Cheering my independence<br>
As long as I agree with them</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I’m not sure what has happened.<br>
I just see it everyday<br>
Kids that are dying<br>
Children that are crying<br>
Dreams crushed<br>
Necks squashed<br>
Not able to catch air<br>
Because nothing real is there</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Needles and pipes<br>
Leaves and flames<br>
Dragging me, drugging me<br>
Tearing me again and again<br>
Just a box to show themselves</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Just a platform to state with pride<br>
“I did my part, I tried”<br>
Even when they’ve done nothing but play games<br>
While they for their own purposes seek fame</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s hard for me to breathe sometimes<br>
Because I do not know who to trust<br>
Politicians, who promise, to get my vote<br>
Others who clamor because they saw me choke<br>
Protected by their guarded gates<br>
No true commitment to change the state</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s hard for me to breathe sometimes<br>
When I see who has already died<br>
Even if you want to put Mr. Floyd, or my sovereignty aside<br>
He can’t hide, I can’t hide<br>
We’re Black, so decide what you want to do<br>
To ignore me is to haunt you. And then hurt you</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s hard for me to breathe sometimes<br>
Especially when you are standing on my neck<br>
Trying to make me break<br>
Pushing me, shoving me, hitting me to forsake<br>
But I’m still awake<br>
Awake because of George,<br>
Awake from those who forged,<br>
A place for me, a time for me,<br>
Gods plan for me, to rise, to breathe, to be</p>

<p>AUHS receives strong support from the City of Signal Hill, California. Students are invited to the City Council meetings, held every quarter, to present to city councilmen. On December 10, 2019 (during National Handwashing week), students educated the public at the City Council meeting on proper handwashing to prevent the spread of diseases. Students also presented the services they have provided to the community, such as blood pressure screenings and flu vaccinations. This presentation to the legislatures exposed students to the importance of advocating for their profession and their patients’ best interest. On March 10, 2020, another group of students took an opportunity to be an instrument to provide accurate information regarding COVID-19 as the latest updates became available from the national and public health officials (ie. WHO, CDC) covering the basic background of the novel Coronavirus with focus on educating public with signs and symptoms and preventative measures such as hand washing and social distancing.</p>
<p>The presentation was well received by the City Council complimented that the students did an excellent job and the slides were appropriate and very pertinent right now.</p>
<p>A flyer was created for distribution purposes to the public to provide further guidance provided by the CDC.</p>

An opportunity as this demonstrates how PharmD students can play a vital role as an instrument to increase public health safety.</p>
<p>Future City Council presentations have been scheduled for June and September 2020 and AUHS hopes to continue this relationship for many more years.</p>

Each person in attendance with a voucher was able to receive a turkey, a box of stuffing, a bag of potatoes, carrots, cranberries, corn, rice, and green beans to take home in time for Thanksgiving dinner. The AUHS foundation passes out vouchers to community partners and resource centers to distribute to families in need of a little assistance. Through this event, AUHS was able to give out free groceries to over 500 local families. Also, free flu shots were administered by Dr. Christine Han, a professor at AUHS and a licensed pharmacist.</p>

 AUHS Honored to Host Ms. Harriet Glickman,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-hosts-harriet-glickman/,,Event Summaries,"<div id=""attachment_13644"" style=""width: 160px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_(Peanuts)""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-13644"" loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-13644"" src=""https://www.auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Franklin_Peanuts.png"" alt=""Franklin Armstrong"" width=""150"" height=""268""></a><p id=""caption-attachment-13644"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Franklin Armstrong is a character in the long-running comic strip Peanuts, created by Charles M. Schulz.</p></div>
<p>On Saturday, November 17, we at AUHS had the honor and the privilege to host Ms. Harriet Glickman as our guest speaker on a day dedicated to giving thanks for all of our blessings – including the blessings of people such as Ms. Glickman who helped bring about the way of life we now enjoy.</p>
<p>In 1968, at the height of the civil rights movement, Ms. Glickman inspired the Peanuts comic strip creator Charles Schulz to introduce the first African-American character, Franklin, to the Peanuts comic. She was working as a school teacher in Los Angeles at the time when she wrote a letter to Schulz, urging him to introduce a black character to the comic. Schulz agreed, and Franklin became one of the few positive representations of the African-American community in the media at the time.</p>
<p>Though this action was certainly a defining moment in American history and a defining moment in the life of Ms. Glickman as well, it was certainly not the sum total of all this amazing woman has contributed. It was a true pleasure to hear Ms. Glickman talk about her experience with the civil rights movement, the story of how she helped make the first African-American character in Peanuts a reality, and her contributions to fairness and equality since. Kind, loving, people such as Ms. Glickman are certainly something for us all to be thankful for this holiday season, and we at AUHS want to thank her from the bottom of our hearts for all she had done and for taking the time to speak to us.</p>

 AUHS Foundation Hosts “Backing Our Future” Backpack Event,https://news.auhs.edu/backing-our-future/,,Event Summaries,"<p>American University of Health Sciences Foundation would like to share the success of our first backpack drive to help underserved elementary school children in our community. Thanks to the generous donations from corporate and individual supporters and AUHS faculty and staff, AUHS Foundation was able to purchase 500 backpacks and fill them with school supplies for students at Lafayette Elementary School, Bobbi Smith Elementary School, Signal Hill Elementary School and Lutheran Social Services of Southern California’s lunch program participants.</p>
<p>With the help of volunteer students, we sorted, packed and delivered the backpacks this week into the hands of eager and grateful students and school counselors who work hard everyday to try to meet the needs of their low-income students. With these backpacks, AUHS Foundation is giving disadvantaged youths the tools they need to succeed at learning.

		<p>Recently, AUHS was proud to host an employer panel featuring some of the top medical professionals in the area who know what it takes to succeed in the medical field. This panel provided an excellent opportunity for our students to gain valuable insights about current hiring trends in the medical field as well as strategies that can be used to maximize the odds of post-graduation success.</p>
<p>The entire event was full of incredibly useful wisdom and insights, and we wanted to take the time now to summarize some of the top takeaways from this informative event.</p>

<li><strong>Succeeding as a Nurse is About Finding Your Passion – </strong>Many do not realize the wide variety of career options that having a degree in nursing opens up. In many ways, succeeding as a nurse is all about finding the path that you are most passionate about and pursuing it to the best of your abilities. As Haley Mehren of DaVita said, “I really think it’s important for you as students to really reflect on what do I really like and how can I find a path for that?…really kind of sit back and observe at this point in time, and figure out what is speaking to you, and what you’re passionate about, and what you’re excited about, and what’s going to get you out of bed in the morning, and there’s a path for that in nursing. I promise you.”</li>
</ul>

		<ul>
<li><strong>Interpersonal Skills are Important – </strong>Amid all of the terminology and technical skills that nurses must learn, the value that employers place on a nurse’s interpersonal skills is often overlooked. When asked what quality the most successful nurses he hired possess, Michael Taguiam – a home health and hospice staffer – said, “What we look for is people that can defuse a situation. People that are smart on their feet and quick to think about what to say to their family.” Esperanza Sanchez of Kindred also added, “Be yourself going in there and be proud of what you accomplished, and just be natural. Be transparent. You cannot promise someone that you can do things that you cannot. Just be yourself.’</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Learn About Your Potential Employer – </strong>Doing your research and fully understanding the job you are applying for is going to yield far better results than applying for positions at random. Deborah Collins – who works at the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services – said, “Learn about the position that you’re applying to. Learn if this is really something that you really think you’re going to be able to do. Do your research.” Cynthia Beja from Kindred also talked about the importance knowing about the position you are applying for, saying, “And if you’re going to apply in surgery, and you’re going to apply in OR, and also apply rehab, that just tells us that you’re not quite certain what you’re doing and you’re just desperate enough to find any place to go.”</li>

<li><strong>Public Health is an Overlooked yet Rewarding Option – </strong>If you are in search of a career that will enable you to give back to your community and help those who need help the most, a career in public health is a highly rewarding option to consider. Pamela Bright – who works as an administrator in public health – said, “Public health is a great job to have if you want to give back to your community. I know I’ve done private industries and yes, you may get paid a more from a private industry, but I will definitely put it out there. Public health is very, very rewarding. We do a lot of things that other organizations don’t do.”</li>

		<p>Recently, AUHS had the privilege of hosting an employer panel featuring medical professionals in charge of the hiring process for their companies, hospitals, and organizations as they shared with our students valuable insight on what employers look for when hiring new nurses. Before the panel discussion began, the event started out with an amazing presentation from Deborah Collins from the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services. The presentation was full of sage advice, interesting anecdotes, and useful takeaways for students on the verge of starting their professional nursing careers. Below are some highlights from Mrs. Collins’ presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Deborah Collins’ Advice for Graduating Students</strong></p>
<div id=""attachment_10308"" style=""width: 270px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-10308"" loading=""lazy"" class="" wp-image-10308"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/deborah-collins-panel.jpg"" alt=""Deborah Collins"" width=""260"" height=""395""><p id=""caption-attachment-10308"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Deborah Collins<br>Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services</p></div>
<p>Deborah started her speech by addressing a concern that is common among graduating nursing students – “will I be able to find a job straight out of college?”. There is certainly the perception that finding a position as a nurse with minimal experience is incredibly difficult, however, Deborah explains that there are plenty of places more than willing to hire graduates, saying, “I want to tell you that there’s a lot of us that will hire new grads. In the City of Long Beach, in the past two years, we’ve hired seven brand new grads and we’ve hired two at the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services where I work. I work in public health. And we’ve hired two in our jail. So there are jobs out there, and I’m sure you’ll hear from our other panelists about other jobs where they will take new grads, because you have to get experience. If you think about all of us here, we were all new grads … a long time ago, but we were all new grads, too, and somebody hired us, and we had that experience, and now we’re in. So we understand where you were and where you’re coming from, because we were there, too.”</p>
<p>Of course, finding a quality position that you enjoy as a nurse – whether you’re a new grad or not – still requires some strategy and effort. Deborah explained that much of this effort has to do with finding the area that you are passionate about and taking every opportunity that you have available to learn about your field.</p>
<p>The number of job opportunities that having a degree in nursing opens up is incredibly wide-ranging. From working as a private nurse for a single patient to working in public health helping an entire community, from working with babies taking their first breath to elderly patients taking their last, the spectrum of positions available to talented nurses is incredibly broad. As Deborah explains, having success as a nurse is all about finding the area that you are most passionate about and pursuing a position in that area with all of your abilities.</p>

		<p>Mrs. Collins also talked about the importance of taking advantage of every opportunity that you have available to learn more about the nursing field and gain experience, saying at one point, “So you might not get the diamond job the first time out, but take the gold job because it’ll lead you to the diamond job. So do the best that you can do and take the job that helps you. My worst experiences have taught me the most and helped me the best.”</p>

 Lamp Unto My Feet – March ’18,https://news.auhs.edu/lamp-unto-my-feet-march-18/,,Event Summaries,"<p><strong><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-9053"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/c-valenzuela.jpg"" alt=""Crystal Valenzuela"" width=""100"" height=""100"">By Crystal Valenzuela</strong></p>
<p>Today I was blessed with the opportunity to serve members of the community in Long Beach, California at the Samaritan House (<a href=""http://lbrm.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Long Beach Rescue Mission</a>). One of the primary reasons I chose to attend American University of Health Sciences was due to this particular annual event. AUHS, along with its staff and faculty provide their students with ample opportunities to go into the surrounding community and make a difference in the lives of individuals.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-9052 alignright"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamp-unto-feet-2.jpg"" alt=""Lamp Unto My Feet"" width=""500"" height=""342"">On March 30, 2018, I participated in the “Lamp Unto My Feet” event. As a team, students of the <a href=""/academics/school-of-nursing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AUHS School of Nursing</a> assembled and successfully orchestrated a pop-up health clinic designed to educate and raise health awareness among the homeless community of Long Beach. AUHS is a Christian Faith-based private university focused on making a difference in local and global communities. The <em>Lamp Unto My Feet</em> event is significant because it serves as a reminder that service to others should be the cornerstone leading to greater understanding of the self as well as a deeper understanding of humanity in its entirety. The Lord, in his all mighty glory, was humbled enough to sit at the feet of his neighbor in order to model for his people acts of kindness and humility.</p>
<p>Good Friday is a day of remembrance of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Also, washing of the feet signifies and reinforces the humility and understanding necessary to live the life Jesus wants individuals to lead. This act reminds individuals that no one is above service and kindness to others. According to biblical scriptures, Jesus stated “Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them”. The act of washing our neighbor’s feet is reflective of the work Jesus conducted during his time on earth and before he died on the cross for the sins of the world.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-9054"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamp-unto-feet-1.jpg"" alt=""Lamp Unto My Feet"" width=""500"" height=""375"">The pop-up health clinic began with the serving of lunch and a prayer in the chapel by Pastor Johnson, who offered uplifting words to inspire positivity and thoughts of hope for patrons of the Long Beach Rescue Mission for the day. Immediately following an educational presentation given by senior AUHS nursing students regarding the importance of oral hygiene and its correlation with heart disease, patrons were escorted out toward the courtyard. In the courtyard, the process of filling out health assessment questionnaires began. Three to five nursing students greeted and checked blood pressure readings for the patrons of the event. Next, patrons proceeded toward the foot wash basins, also manned by sincere students willing to help, myself included. Clean socks were handed out, in addition to expert advice on medications from the up and coming pharmacy program faculty. Lastly, patrons were handed small backpacks containing hygiene products necessary for self-care.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience at the <em>Lamp Unto My Feet</em> event was a positive one. Of the handful of individuals, one woman, in particular who&nbsp;I was able to help stands out. The woman was middle aged and it was obvious that she had been weathered by the sun. She had a history of diabetes since giving birth to her first child. Together, we briefly discussed gestational diabetes and I queried about her knowledge of insulin administration, her bouts with peripheral neuropathy and the importance of wound care in diabetics. She had a small wound on the bottom of one of her toes, she said she is “keeping an eye on it” and that she appreciated all of the students help. I feel like I learned a lot about myself as well. By listening to some of the stories these people shared, I realized being homeless can happen to anyone at any time. One woman stated that she attended Berkeley at one point in her life and that she had a “little misstep” and that, she would be able to “make it right eventually”. These were people from all walks of life, young, old, African American, Hispanic, Caucasian, Native American, male and female. However, one thing they all had in common, other than attending the free event was that they were sincerely appreciative of the event. There were plenty of “thank you (s)” and “bless you(s)” going around. I appreciated the opportunity to make a difference in the Long Beach community it reminded me that there are plenty of people in this world who are willing to dedicate their valuable time in order to make a difference in the life of those in need.</p>

 What is Easter?,https://news.auhs.edu/what-is-easter/,,Articles,"<p>What is Easter? Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. According to the Bible, the event occurred three days after Jesus was crucified and died around 30 A.D. This holiday first begins with Lent which is a 40 day period of prayer and sacrifice and concludes with Holy Week that consists of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday. Although Easter is a holiday Christian faith and tradition, it dates back to pagan times that were before Christians.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-8685 alignleft"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/easter-02.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""335"">Easter 2018 was on Sunday, April 1st, however, this holiday falls on a different date each year depending on the calendar. Western Christianity follows the Gregorian calendar so Easter will always fall on a Sunday between the dates of March 22nd and April 25th. Many of the traditions and symbols in Easter observances have roots from pagan celebrations such as the pagan goddess Eostre and the ancient Germnic goddess of Spring. The belief and foundation that led up to the Easter holiday was from the New Testament that said, Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities because he claimed to be the “Son of God” as well as some historians claiming the Romans may have viewed Jesus as a threat to the empire. Jesus was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate and crucified on the Christian Holiday, Good Friday which is the Friday before Easter. When Jesus had resurrected three days later, the authors of the gospel spoke that he was the living son of God. The New Testament, (Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John) states those who believe in Jesus’ death and resurrection, the individual is given the gift of eternal life and welcomed into the “Kingdom of Heaven” upon earthly death. In varying ways, all four of the gospels in the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) state that those who believe in Jesus’ death and resurrection are given “the gift of eternal life,” meaning that those of faith will be welcomed into the “Kingdom of Heaven” upon their earthly death.</p>
<p>In western Christianity including Roman Catholicism, the period of fasting and penitence is called Lent and begins on Ash Wednesday and lasts for 40 days and doesn’t include Sundays. The Sunday before the Easter Sunday is called Palm Sunday and symbolizes Jesus’ arrival in Jerusalem where palm leaves were laid on the road to greet him. The Easter Vigil is the religious service that is observed in the late hours of the day on Holy Saturday.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-8686"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/easter-01.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""335"">In current tradition, Easter eggs are widely known and celebrated on Easter Sunday. There are many activities that include egg rolling, egg decorating, and egg hunting for smaller children. Inside the Easter eggs there are either suprises of money or candy and these eggs are hidden in various places for the children to find and gather as much as he or she can in each of the baskets. In some households, a character known as the Easter bunny gives candy and other treats to children on Easter Sunday and is often packaged in a decorative Easter basket. The source of origin of the Easter bunny tradition is unknown although historians note that rabbits in many cultures are known as “enthusiastic procreators” and the arrival of baby bunnies symbolize birth and renewal. Today, Easter is both a commercialized event and a religious holiday.</p>

 Reflections of Holy Week,https://news.auhs.edu/reflections-of-holy-week/,,Articles,"<p>Holy Week for Christians is the week before Easter. It is known as a week of reflection based on the events leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus. These events begin with Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem on what is now called Palm Sunday. It is followed by the Last Supper with the twelve apostles, Judas’ betrayal, Jesus’ arrest, crucifixion and death, His burial in the tomb, and finally His resurrection on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-8641"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Holy-Week-Feature-300x201.jpg"" alt=""Holy Week 2018"" width=""300"" height=""201"">Palm Sunday celebrates Jesus’ return to Jerusalem. According to the gospels, the people in Jerusalem waved and spread branches on the ground. Palm Sunday is the turning point in Jesus’ ministry. This is the first time that he is publicly recognized as the Messiah, the Son of God. Holy Thursday, also known as Maundy Thursday is significant because of three key events. First, Jesus shows his disciples through the washing of their feet, the true meaning of being a servant to each other. Second, by declaring the bread and wine as His flesh and blood, Jesus demonstrates the way in which He will always be with us, even after death. Finally, it is on this night that Jesus is betrayed by Judas thereby fulfilling the prophecies of His life and death. On Good Friday Christians often reflect, through fasting and prayer, on the carrying of the cross and the crucifixion of Jesus. From the time of the betrayal to His death, Jesus experiences the abandonment of his disciples, the tribulations of Pilate and Herod in identifying His alleged crimes, the vicious display from religious leaders and the crowds calling for his death – all this before the beatings, the crown of thorns, and the carrying of the cross for miles. Once nailed to the cross, Jesus’ suffering escalates. Yet, He turns to the Father and focuses on the salvation of others until His last breath.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of the story. Holy Week culminates on Easter Sunday with the glorious resurrection of Jesus. This is the Holiest week of the Christian year. It is a time of prayerful reflection and coming together as Christians to reminisce upon and be grateful for the sacrifices Jesus made for our salvation. This is what it means to be one with Jesus.</p>

Since the 17<sup>th</sup> century, it has evolved into festivals all over the world including dancing, special foods, and music. The holiday happens to fall during the Christian season of Lent. During Lenten season, families go to church in the morning and celebrate in the afternoon with Irish bacon and cabbage as tradition. He is honored most for his missionary work and spreading of Christianity.</p>
<p>Patrick was born in the 4<sup>th</sup> century A.D. in Britain. He was the son of Calphurnius who was a deacon and Conchessa as his mother who was a close relative of St. Martin of tours. Although his family came from a strong religious background, Patrick was not raised with a strong emphasis on religion nor education. At the age of 16, he got kidnapped by pirates and taken to Ireland to work as a slave. He was held in captivity by his master Milchu, who was a high priest of Druidism that held major religious influence in Ireland at the time, it kept him in bondage. Throughout the six years, he was kept in bondage, Patrick deepened his faith in Christianity by prayer everyday because he believed it was a test of his faith in God. He then had a vision of the pagan children of Ireland reaching out to him. Through that, he became determined to convert Ireland to Christianity and made it be part of his life’s path. In 408 A.D. Patrick had a dream where a voice told him to escape enslavement and return back home. Soon after, he boarded a ship with sailors and set sail that landed in France three days later. He reunited once again with his family and went to Auxerre, France to enter priesthood under the guidance of the missionary St. Germain.</p>
<p>As he deepened himself in priesthood, he became deacon around 418 A.D.&nbsp; His vision of converting Ireland to Christianity was still within him and had never lost sight of it. When he was ordained as bishop by 432 A.D. he was sent by Pope Celestine I to Ireland to spread the word of God as well as provide support the small community of Christians who were already living there. Upon arrival, St. Patrick began his missionary work through preaching, writing, and performing baptisms. He supported church officials, founded monasteries, and managed to make Ireland in dioceses. Many believe St. Patrick introduced the Celtic cross that consisted of both Pagan and Christianity symbols. He passed away in 461 A.D. in Saul, Ireland and was buried in a nearby town of Downpatrick. He is honored and has been associated with the legends such as when he drove away all the snakes from Ireland as well as introducing the holy trinity through the three-leaved shamrock.</p>
<p>Today, his name and his legacy are celebrated throughout the whole world with including Japan, Hong Kong, all parts of Europe and North America. It is customary to wear shamrocks or the color green because it is the color that Catholics associate with for a holiday. Although St. Patrick was not the sole proprietor of converting Ireland to Christianity, he had made an everlasting imprint and legacy to many believers.</p>

The event included rallies and organized meetings in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Denmark. The date of March 19 was chosen because it commemorated the day a Prussian king who promised equality and voting for women in which he later failed to do so.&nbsp; Later, The International Women’s day was moved to March 8 in 1913. According to the UN, there is nowhere in the world where women have the same rights as men. On average, women receive 30 to 40 percent less pay than men for the same work and have continued to e victims of domestic violence and rape. Today, many women have taken the issues to social media that have campaigns known as #metoo and “Time’s Up” where women wear all black.</p>
<p>International Women’s Day is held worldwide every March 8 that include women from all walks of life such as business leader, educators, political leaders, entrepreneurs, and television personalities who are invited to speak at various events. The theme and messages these events focus on are the importance of education for women, career opportunities, portrayal of women in the media, and standing our ground for women’s rights. International Women’s Day is a public holiday in countries such as Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine that hold street marches and wide-scale events.</p>
<p>Venus is the symbol of International Women’s Day with colors of purple and white that represents female. Women have turned to colors of clothing as a representation of their protests. As previously said when women wore black for the “Time’s up” campaign, on this day they wear purple because it is the official color of the public holiday and it signifies justice and dignity. So let us all honor the women of the world today – for their achievements economically, socially, politically. For their courage to stand up and demand respect for not only their bodies but their place as women standing next to men.</p>

 Study Finds that Millennials are Twice as Likely to Choose a Career in Nursing as Baby Boomers,https://news.auhs.edu/millennials-twice-as-likely-to-choose-career-in-nursing-as-baby-boomers/,,Articles,"<p>­­­­­<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-8382"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nurses-doctor.jpg"" alt=""Nurses and doctor"" width=""500"" height=""333"">For years, healthcare professionals have worried about the shortage of nurses that the industry is likely to face after baby boomer nurses have retired. Now, it seems as if the millennial generation is rising to the call, as one study shows that millennials are twice as likely to choose a career in nursing as the baby boomers were before them.</p>
<p><strong>Why Nursing is Attracting Millennials</strong></p>
<p>The first and most obvious reason why more millennials are choosing to pursue careers in nursing is the rising demand for qualified nurses. At a time when the elderly population is growing and the majority of nurses are nearing retirement, there is a huge demand for nurses to fill the positions of these retirees and continue providing care for the growing elderly population. With huge demand comes an easier time finding a job as well as increased pay, making nursing an attractive career option for millennials just now entering the workforce. While more millennials are going into nursing then ever before, this demand for nurses still isn’t expected to go away any time soon.</p>
<p>Beyond this, though, nursing is attracting more millennials largely in part to the values that the millennial generation exhibits. Millennials, perhaps more than any other generation before them, value careers that allow them to make a positive difference in the world, and caring for the sick and helpless as a nurse certainly qualifies as such a career.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>At American University of Health Sciences, we’re excited to see the interest that millennials are showing in nursing careers. Without a doubt, this is a field full of both financial opportunity as well as the opportunity to promote goodness and well-being in the world. If you would like to answer the call for more qualified nurses and embark on one of the most fulfilling careers in the world today, we invite you to learn more about the <a href=""/academics/school-of-nursing/bachelor-science-nursing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bachelor of Science in Nursing program</a> we offer in the <a href=""/academics/school-of-nursing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">School of Nursing</a> at AUHS.</p>

 America’s Pastor Billy Graham Passes Away at the Age of 99,https://news.auhs.edu/pastor-billy-graham-passes-away/,,Articles,"<p>In James chapter four, the Bible tells us that we are but a vapor that appears for a little time before it is gone. It’s what we do with this small piece of time that we’ve been given, though, that makes all the difference.</p>
<p>From an eternal perspective, Pastor Billy Graham – who passed away on the morning of February 21 at the age of 99 – may have only been on this earth a short while. However, the impact he made on God’s kingdom will last long after all of us alive today are gone.</p>
<div id=""attachment_8254"" style=""width: 610px"" class=""wp-caption alignleft""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-8254"" loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-8254 size-full"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/billy-graham-crusade.jpg"" alt=""Billy Graham"" width=""600"" height=""342""><p id=""caption-attachment-8254"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Pastor Billy Graham</p></div>
<p>Over the course of his life, Billy Graham was able to preach the Gospel to an estimated 215 million people in countries all over the world. His presence on evangelical radio and television programs was near constant, and he published more than two-dozen best-selling books in which he shared the faith that had changed his life so much.</p>
<p>Through it all, Billy Graham’s kind, charismatic demeanor earned him the respect and admiration of people from all walks of life. Martin Luther King Jr. considered the pastor a close friend and once said, “Had it not been for the ministry of my <a href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/living/religion/article201319074.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">good friend</a> Dr. Billy Graham, my work in the civil rights movement would not have been as successful as it has been.” Even Presidents and world leaders took the time to meet with Billy Graham and listen closely to the spiritual advice he had to offer.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the famous and influential that admired Billy Graham and his work – the pastor has appeared on Gallup’s list of the most admired men and women in the world for sixty straight years.</p>
<p>At AUHS, so many of our faculty, teachers, and students have been impacted by the life and work of Pastor Billy Graham. While we are no-doubt saddened by the news of his passing, we want to focus instead on the legacy that he has left behind. In passing, Billy Graham has left the world a better place than it would have been without him. He’s also left this world <em>for</em> a better place as well. And that is certainly something worth celebrating.</p>

 The History of Valentine’s Day,https://news.auhs.edu/history-of-valentines-day/,,Articles,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7875"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Valentines-with-students.jpg"" alt="""" width=""360"" height=""270"">There are several stories as to who he is; a popular belief is that he was a priest from Rome in the third century. Valentine was believed to have broken the rules on banned marriages and arranged marriages instead. He was thrown in jail and sentenced to death. While in prison, he fell in love with the jailer’s daughter and when he was taken to be killed was on February 14 and it was believed he sent her a letter “from your Valentine.” &nbsp;That is another theory on how the day got its name and how letters were written from that time. From that day on St. Valentine’s name was used by people to express their feelings of love for one another.</p>
<p>The first Valentine’s day cards were sent out in the 18th century. They were initially handmade because pre-made cards weren’t available. It meant a lot more than when you would make them by hand. The time and effort were put into it. The person making these cards would decorate the paper with romantic symbols and write in some poetry. Some remained anonymous; others would address it to “My Valentine.” The oldest examples of premade cards didn’t start until the late 1700’s. They soon became famous and well known for its rapid printing and manufacturing technologies in those times.&nbsp; It was by the mid-1800’s that Valentine cards were immensely popular and all around known, especially in London. There is a wide collection of Valentine day cards held at the Museum of London from those time periods. &nbsp;Back in those times, the more elaborate the card was, it meant that your lover spent more money on it. It was apparent to see back then because of those beautiful details. There was a feature based on the most elaborate card in the collection which was handmade and believed that it was given to the King’s future wife and served as part of the proposal which she happily accepted. After they got married, they went on to have 15 children. One of whom they named Valentine.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-7876 alignleft"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Giovanna-Campos.jpg"" alt="""" width=""360"" height=""270"">Not every card was made to be romantic; people were also able to buy vinegar valentines, these cards were designed to insult. They were either to bash a man’s profession or a woman’s appearance. One that is kept in a collection at the University of Birmingham is a cartoon of a woman with a large nose and is titled Miss Nosey and to receive a card like this was a great insult. There were also cards that were humorous that was a popular choice even back then. It wasn’t always about romance; it was also about taking things lightly especially regarding friendships. Finally, in 1913, Hallmark produced their first Valentine day card which is one like we would see today.&nbsp; A couple embracing, in a near kiss. It’s what brought us to what we call modern love today, where Hallmark has become highly known for all things, love from stuffed animals to pop-up letters, and music boxes. It’s a day that won’t soon be forgotten, even those who try to shun from it.</p>
<p>This day, February 14 is here to stay. A day of love, friendship, and peace. It’s also a day where many people take a chance and express how they feel. Some remain anonymous and others make the people they love as if they’re the center of the world. Whatever the case may be, Valentine’s day is a day that might’ve had some dark origins but from that became a positive day that is celebrated with love. One that might be taken lightly by some and others take it to heart. Regardless of where we may fall on that spectrum, we can all agree that it is turned into something very beautiful, anything that is given with heart is worth remembering.</p>

 Experts Predict Big Changes Coming to Clinical Research,https://news.auhs.edu/experts-predict-big-changes-coming-to-clinical-research/,,Articles,"<p>Underneath the clinical trials that have led to so many breakthrough treatments and medications lies a concerning amount of ambiguity and uncertainty. Far too often, separate clinical trials will yield wildly different results in spite of testing the same drug or treatment.</p>
<div id=""attachment_7609"" style=""width: 240px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-7609"" loading=""lazy"" class="" wp-image-7609"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/d-berry.jpg"" alt=""Donald Berry"" width=""230"" height=""345""><p id=""caption-attachment-7609"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Donald Berry</p></div>
<p>According to one of the world’s leading experts in clinical trials, Don Berry, “The standard clinical trial is pretty much the only thing in medicine that hasn’t changed in the last 70 years.”</p>
<p>Now, though, some experts are predicting that big changes are on the horizon. In an attempt to generate more consistent results that can actually provide researchers with incredibly valuable data about the drug they are testing, experts are predicting that clinical researchers in the near future will begin to leverage tools such as machine learning and adaptive trials. These methods will be designed to better anticipate which drugs will perform well and eliminate much of the uncertainty that current clinical trials sometimes deliver. If they are successful in this task, the benefits could be huge.</p>
<p>Of course, in order to bring about major changes to the way clinical trials are conducted, the medical field is going to have to rely on a new generation of talented clinical researchers who are dedicated to developing new ideas and delivering better results than ever before. With the help of modern technology, these clinical researchers may be able to forever change the way clinical trials are conducted.</p>
<p>With all of that said, the opportunity is certainly there for bright young minds to enter this field, bringing with them fresh ideas and a new approach to a set of procedures that has changed very little over the past decades. If you would like to be a part of making a difference in the way new drugs are tested – delivering more effective treatments to the people who need them most – then we invite you to learn more about our <a href=""/academics/school-of-pharmacy/ms-clinical-research/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Masters of Science in Clinical Research program</a>.</p>
<p>For those interested in clinical research, the opportunity to change the world is knocking. It’s up to you to decide if you will answer the call.</p>

It was held in conjunction with the 5th Annual Health and Wellness Fair as an introduction to what will become an annual community event.</p>
<p>The event attracted children from ages 4-12 and their families. They browsed the stacks of books for potential reading material to take home. The AUHS Librarian and student volunteers spent the duration of the event inquiring about reading preferences and offering book suggestions. A variety of books were available to take home, from classics by Dr. Seuss to the famous Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. All quickly found new homes in the hands of eager children. Also, children were invited to an activities table to complete puzzles and coloring activities as they waited for entry into the health fair.<br>
The book giveaway was made possible by the AUHS Foundation who provided brand new books to distribute and through the efforts of the AUHS Student Nurses Association (SNA) who spearheaded the collection of gently used books from AUHS students and administration.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-7175"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bookfair-002.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""314"">In countless studies, it has been proven that educational and lifelong success is tied to early exposure to books and being read to. In particular, the number of books a child has at home directly correlates to a child’s literacy development and academic achievement. The idea to organize a book fair was born from the desire to find ways promote childhood literacy. The book fair marks one of the first steps in doing so by providing access to quality, age appropriate, reading material at no cost to the community.</p>
<p>With a big thank you to the efforts of all involved who helped make the Book Fair a success, we look forward to hosting another book fair in the near future.</p>

		<h3><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-7073"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sna-logo-300x141.png"" alt=""AUHS Student Nurses Association"" width=""300"" height=""141"">By Jessica Lara, SNA President 2017</h3>
<p>On Monday, October 30, 2017, the Student Nurses Association (SNA) at the American University of Health Sciences held our first “Trunk or Treat” Event. The event was held between the hours of 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM at the university parking lot located on Walnut and Hill.</p>
<p>The idea for “Trunk-or-Treat” had been suggested last Fall by our former SNA President, Breeanne Rodriguez. With the help and support from the University’s administration, faculty and student body, the AUHS SNA was able to launch the event this year, and it was successful!</p>
<p><strong>About “Trunk-Or-Treat”</strong><br>
“Trunk-or-Treat” itself is a fun little spin on the Halloween tradition, “trick- or-treat.” In this case, trick-or-<br>
treating is done from car to car rather than from house to house.</p>
<p>Given that this was the first year SNA held this event, the SNA Board of Directors (BOD) and Cohort Representatives agreed that for this run, the cars used would be our own. The decorations used were bought by each participant with some donated by Kristen Soegeng.</p>
<p>To have more student involvement we invited the students of each cohort to participate in a contest that consisted of donating treats (i.e., candy, fruit snacks, cookies, etc.) and car decorations.</p>

 I am Blessed – Pray it Forward 2017,https://news.auhs.edu/i-am-blessed-a-garnacias/,,Event Summaries,"<h3>By April Garnacias, AUHS Student</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a-garnacias-02-300x300.jpg"" alt=""April Garnacias, AUHS Student"" width=""300"" height=""300"">When the opportunity to do “Pray it Forward” arose, I was very eager to take the chance as my first community service activity here at AUHS.</p>
<p>Despite my excitement, I felt nervous at the thought of speaking to strangers. However, the scenario of my first encounter made me think otherwise. My first 5 dollar bill and prayer was given to a homeless woman in a wheelchair. When I offered the lady five dollars, she was incredibly thankful and very willing to take a photo. She was curious about the activity and what school I attended, so I explained to her the mission and philosophy of AUHS. <img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-7130"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a-garnacias-03-300x300.jpg"" alt=""April Garnacias"" width=""300"" height=""300"">Then, she opened up to me and proceeded to tell me her story about her journey through health. She also introduced me to a friend of her’s that she met at a homeless shelter, who was pushing her wheelchair. As an infant, she was told that she would not live past seven years old. The tumors on her body multiplied, but the expenses were too much for her to afford treatment, but because of prayer, she is still living at forty years old. Regardless of her struggle for money, as soon as she received enough, she took a group of her friends who were also homeless, to eat at a restaurant. They thanked her, but she told them, “Don’t thank me, thank God. He is the reason why I can help you today.” Lastly, she said to me about difficulties with conceiving, with her health condition and that the doctor said that she would not have a successful pregnancy. Her daughter is now nineteen years old daughter and is working as a bodyguard and is going to school to help disabled children. This woman’s faith was very apparent in her voice. When we parted ways, she thanked God out loud.</p>
<p>In total, I gave 30 dollars away. I was surprised at how quickly it was to come across a homeless person. In our daily routine, we don’t realize how many people are in desperate need, in our neighborhood. This made me feel blessed for everything that I have. “Pray it Forward” opened my eyes to the hearts of the homeless and showed me that there is also a gift for giving.</p>

 2017 American University of Health Sciences Commencement Ceremony,https://news.auhs.edu/2017-auhs-commencement-ceremony/,,University News,"<p>On Friday, June 30, 2017, AUHS held their tenth annual commencement ceremony to celebrate the accomplishments of the 2017 class. The event took place at the Long Beach Convention Center and was proceeded by a pinning ceremony during which the university’s newly graduated nurses were presented with their pins welcoming them into the profession of nursing.</p>
<p>After the prelude, processional, and presentation of colors, the National Anthem was sung by the talented Jane Kim and Roshaun Carlise Stovell and the invocation was given by the founder of AUHS, Pastor Gregory A. Johnson. The president and CEO of AUHS <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WlZJfQe6gs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dr. Caroll Ryan</a> then welcomed all in attendance and made some opening remarks.</p>
<p>Afterward, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ZvLCYwTwE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pastor Johnson and his wife and co-founder Kim Dang</a> reflected on the many milestones of AUHS, citing the university’s recent accreditation by WASC as one of the most monumental milestones for the both the university’s faculty and its students. Their combined remarks served as a proud reminder of where AUHS has come from since its founding twenty-three years ago and where we are today.</p>

 Career Opportunities Created by the Magnet Program,https://news.auhs.edu/career-opportunities-created-magnet-program/,,Articles,"<p>Thanks to the Magnet program, the need for nurses holding a BSN degree is now higher than ever. While nurses have always offered a high degree of value to the hospitals who employ them, the Magnet program highlights the need for high-quality, educated nurses and provides hospitals with a compelling incentive to improve their nursing staff.</p>
<p><strong><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-6507"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nurses-magnet-program.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""287"">What is the Magnet Program?</strong></p>
<p>The Magnet program was created by the &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nursecredentialing.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Nurses’ Credentialing Center</a>&nbsp;(ANCC) which is an affiliate of the American Nurses Association. In this program, an award known as the Magnet award is presented to hospitals whose nursing staff satisfy a rigorous set of criteria. These criteria include positive patient experiences with the hospital’s nurses, a high degree of job satisfaction by the hospital’s nurses, low turnover rate in nursing positions, effective grievance resolution, and other demonstrations that a hospital’s nursing staff is fully capable of delivering the highest possible level of care to the hospital’s patients.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Magnet Program is Creating More Opportunities for BSN Nurses</strong></p>
<p>Receiving a Magnet award is a valuable recognition that hospitals can use to attract more patients. After all, patients want to know that the nurses who will be taking care of them are happy with their jobs, dedicated to providing a positive outcome and experience, and given the tools they need by the hospital they work for.</p>
<p>With this being the case, there are incentives for hospitals to earn a Magnet award, and one of the best ways for a hospital to meet the criteria necessary for receiving a Magnet award is to increase the number of BSN nurses they have on staff.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of nurses a hospital has on staff increases the job satisfaction of the nursing staff by ensuring they are not overworked and allowing them to focus their attention on fewer patients. A larger nursing pool also tends to increase the level of care provided to patients, making the patients more likely to report a positive experience with the hospital’s nursing staff.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, is the hospital’s need to increase the number of BSN nurses they have on staff. Nurses who have earned their BSN are more qualified to provide superior patient care, and a hospital whose nursing staff contains a higher percentage of nurses with BSN degrees is more likely to be awarded the coveted Magnet award.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Magnet program and the opportunities are better than ever for highly-qualified nurses, and the job market for nurses who have earned a BSN is now more promising than ever, making now an excellent time to pursue a <a href=""/school-of-nursing/son-academic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bachelor of Science in Nursing</a>.</p>

 How the Magnet Program is Helping Improve Hospitals’ Nursing Staff,https://news.auhs.edu/magnet-program-helping-improve-hospitals-nursing-staff/,,Articles,"<p>When the Magnet program and the award that accompanied it was first introduced by the American Nurses Credentialing Center&nbsp;(ANCC), the goal of the program was to help hospitals across the nation improve the quality of care offered by their nursing staff by shining a spotlight on the need for qualified nurses who are happy with their jobs and are given the tools and resources they need to provide exceptional patient care.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6537"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hospital-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"">Thus far, the program is working. Given the incentive of receiving the Magnet award, hospitals are putting more effort toward promoting the practices outlined by the program and are working harder at giving their nursing staff the resources needed to succeed. So far, the results have been telling.</p>
<p>One <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2013/05000/Lower_Mortality_in_Magnet_Hospitals.2.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2013 study</a> showed that Magnet hospitals have a 14% lower mortality rate as well as a 12% lower failure to rescue rate. A <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/jonajournal/Abstract/2011/12000/Comparison_of_Patient_Outcomes_in_Magnet__and.7.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2011 study</a> showed that Magnet hospitals provided higher quality of care and more nursing innovations than non-magnet hospitals, and another <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/jonajournal/Abstract/2011/10000/Nurse_Outcomes_in_Magnet__and_Non_Magnet_Hospitals.9.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2011 study</a> is quoted saying, that Magnet hospitals “have better work environments, a more highly educated nursing workforce, superior nurse-to-patient staffing ratios, and higher nurse satisfaction than non-Magnet hospitals.”</p>
<p><strong>What the Success of the Magnet Program Means for Those in the Nursing Field </strong></p>
<p>The benefit of the Magnet program for patients in Magnet hospitals has been proven, but what particular benefits does the Magnet program offer to the nurses themselves? In addition to encouraging a better work environment and higher job satisfaction, one key benefit that the Magnet program offers to those in the nursing field is that it is creating a need for highly educated nurses.</p>
<p>Looking back at the quote from the 2011 study, you’ll note that one of the things found in Magnet hospitals is a “more highly educated nursing workforce”. Indeed, one of the best ways that hospitals can meet the requirements for the Magnet award is to increase the number of nurses on staff who have earned their BSN degree. As such, the need for BSN nurses has never been higher.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt the Magnet program is succeeding in its mission to highlight the importance of educated, equipped, and satisfied nurses, and in doing so it is making the need for more nurses who have earned their BSN degree all the more prevalent. The Magnet program highlights the need for highly educated nurses in today’s hospitals, and it’s already creating a number of benefits for both patients and nurses alike.</p>

 10 Things You Should Know About Brain Tumors,https://news.auhs.edu/10-things-know-brain-tumors/,,Articles,"<p><strong><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6287"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BrainTumorAwarenessMay2017-300x169.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169"">Romans 8:38-39 </strong><em>For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</em></p>
<p>May is National Brain Tumor Awareness Month, and American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) encourages you to seek information about brain tumors, learn about its symptoms and treatments, and help spread awareness! Here are 10 facts you should know about brain tumors and brain cancer.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is a brain tumor? A brain tumor is “an abnormal growth of tissue in the brain or central spine that can disrupt proper brain function. Doctors refer to a tumor based on where the tumor cells originated, and whether they are cancerous (malignant) or not (benign),” according to <a href=""http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/understanding-brain-tumors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">braintumor.org</a>.</li>
<li>Brain tumors come in all shapes and sizes. There are over 120 types of brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors, and brain and spinal cord tumors are different for every individual. These tumors can form in different areas, develop from different cell types, and may have different treatment options, according to <a href=""http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/understanding-brain-tumors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">braintumor.org</a>.</li>
<li>The symptoms of brain tumors can vary depending on their type and location, and there have been cases where a person suffering from a brain tumor may experience no symptoms at all. Common symptoms of a brain tumor include recurrent headaches, memory loss, poor coordination, vision problems, changes in behavior or personality, difficulty in speech, and unexplained nausea or vomiting.</li>
<li>In 2017, an estimated 79,270 new cases of primary malignant (cancerous) and non-malignant (non-cancerous) brain and other CNS tumors are expected to be diagnosed in the United States, according to <a href=""http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS)</a>.</li>
<li>Approximately one-third of brain and CNS tumors are malignant (cancerous), according to the <a href=""http://www.abta.org/about-us/news/brain-tumor-statistics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA)</a>.</li>
<li>Cancers of the brain occur in people of all ages but more frequently in two age groups: Children younger than 15 years old and adults 65 years and older, according to the <a href=""https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showCancerBrainEnv"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</a></li>
<li>An estimated 16,947 deaths will be attributed to primary malignant brain and other CNS tumors in the US in 2017, according to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS)</a>.</li>
<li>Brain and CNS tumors are the third most common cancer occurring among adolescents and young adults (ages 15-39) and the third most common cause of cancer death in this age group, according to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4690545/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Brain Tumor Association</a>.</li>
<li>The five–year relative survival rate in the US following diagnosis of a primary malignant brain or other CNS tumor is 34.7% (33.5% for males and 36.1% for females), according to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS)</a>.</li>
<li>Brain tumors have the highest per-patient initial cost of care for any cancer group, with an annualized mean net costs of care in 2010 in the United States well over $100,000 per patient, according to&nbsp;<a href=""http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/brain-tumor-facts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">braintumor.org</a>.</li>

 Our Time and Our Season,https://news.auhs.edu/time-season/,,Morning Dew,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6281"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/a-morning-dew-image-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225"">American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) faculty and staff, and candidates for AUHS’ <a href=""/school-of-nursing/"">School of Nursing (SON)</a> program gathered at the 2nd Floor Conference room for weekly <em>Morning Dew</em> biblical reflection every Monday at 9 am. The weekly Morning Dew was lead by Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS.</p>
<p>At the weekly <em>Morning Dew</em> these past Mondays, AUHS reflected on the rigorous preparation for <a href=""http://www.tracs.org/"">TRACS</a> site visit scheduled for June 12-15, 2017.&nbsp; Everyone&nbsp; shared reflective thoughts on the following biblical verses:</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:3</strong> For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.</p>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 4:7</strong> For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 42:8</strong>, the Lord says, “I am the Lord, that is My name; I will not give my glory to another, nor My praise to graven images.”</p>
<p><strong>Acts 12:21</strong> On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 22 They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man. Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel 4:29</strong> Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, 30 he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?” 31 Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, “This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you. 32 You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.”</p>
<p><em>To realize ones dream is a marvelous thing. To realize, not you, but God’s Hand which did bring, is most wondrous of all.</em></p>
<p><strong>NO ONE</strong></p>
<p>No one person can achieve great success.<br>
No one person can bring about what God deems best<br>
There are many hands, which take hold of oar<br>
That work to bring any ship to shore<br>
And, none more sure than Gods.</p>
<p><strong>BE CAREFUL</strong></p>
<p>Be careful in your eagerness to accept praise<br>
Or in exalting yourself when victory plays<br>
Better to look about and give much due<br>
To God and those who most labored true</p>
<p><strong>GLORY</strong></p>
<p>When the day is spent and you see the Son<br>
When the hours have passed and you realize you’ve won<br>
Take time. Make time to thank those few<br>
Who in discomfort gave all effort to.<br>
Making sure, each little thing, was done well<br>
Thereby, preventing our heads to swell<br>
For indeed in all scripture and in every story<br>
The wise, give God the Glory</p>
<p><strong>SUDDENLY</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly the moment came.<br>
By His Spirit, not one could refrain.<br>
To praise, His Holy name.</p>

<p>AUHS was in the process of obtaining regional accreditation from <a href=""https://www.wscuc.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)&nbsp;</a> and was scheduled to have a site visit that week from April 25-27, 2017. Pastor Johnson prayed for and offered many words of encouragement to AUHS faculty, staff, students, and prospective students at this crucial point in time.</p>
<p>The members of the room each took turns reading the following passages out loud and discussed what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><em>As everything is beautiful in its time. So is God’s hand divine.</em></p>
<p><em>He brings to pass what promises to you made. So be confident and having labored, be stayed.</em></p>
<p>There a time and season for everything. Dr. David Hawkins, the AUHS Dean of Pharmacy, explained to the SON candidates that AUHS was in the process of regional accreditation from WASC and were scheduled to have a site visit the following day.</p>
<p>“Accreditations can be a really rigorous process. There’s nobody in his or her right mind who would not be a little nervous about going through this,” Dr. Hawkins said, “But God intervenes on our behalf and therefore we can be confident. We should not be overconfident, we should be humble, but we can be confident that He will get us through this and He will help us be granted initial accreditation from WASC.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson reminded everyone in the room to never lose faith in themselves, their institution, and their God.</p>
<p>“We don’t always see what’s happening behind the scenes. We don’t always know how God orchestrate things,” Pastor Johnson said, “But God does everything for a reason. There is a time and season for everything and God brought us together so that He can use us as vessels complete His good work.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson fondly looked at each person across the room and recalled some of the blessed memories he shared with his colleagues in the institution. He shared how he met Dr. Hawkins about eight years ago and how they had talked about standardizations and the challenges of standardizing education. Pastor Johnson remembered how he met Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the AUHS President of Operations and Development, and how he tried “fifty-thousand times” to convince her to come work for the institution. Pastor Johnson also remembered talking to Dr. Mok Chong, the Dean of General Education, about Hawaii and geckos.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson was not only thankful for the people in his past who helped the university grow and thrive throughout the years, he also looked forward to the future of AUHS. One of the things that concerned Pastor Johnson the most about the future of the university is that the people who succeed him will not continue God’s legacy.</p>
<p>“My greatest worry is we might get the wrong people to lead the university. People who do not fear God and all of the blessings that He had given us will away,” Pastor Johnson said, “But now I can be rest assured that if I am no longer here on this Earth, AUHS is surrounded by people that will keep the legacy of God in this university. I am convinced that God has orchestrated some powerful people who love the Lord, smart people who love the Lord, committed people who love the Lord, humble people who love the Lord to watch over this institution and all will be well. Amen.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson believed that Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, was the right person to lead AUHS into a new season.</p>
<p>“Everything that God does is so perfect in His time. Dr. Ryan sits here not just as the President but as someone who loves and fears God,” Pastor Johnson said, “She is someone who understands excellence. She is someone who understands the timing and the season.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the university played an essential role in God’s plan, even prospective students, according to Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p>“All of us are important to God’s work. The nursing candidates here today, are also important to God’s work. We are all connected to the great destiny that God has given to all of us,” Pastor Johnson said, “This is our time, this is our season. This is your time and this is your season. Do not truncate God because what God has in store for you is bigger than what you could ever imagine.”</p>
<p><strong>Know </strong></p>
<p><em>Know that this then is the season for you</em></p>
<p><em>For in it, God makes blossom His promise true</em></p>
<p>Dr. Hawkins offered some insight of how he felt about WASC and how he believed AUHS would be successful.</p>
<p>“This week is going to blossom for us. We should look forward to meeting with the WASC team and answering their questions truthfully. Let us show them all that we do that is good and let us show them all that we do that we are proud of,” Dr. Hawkins said, “We should listen to the WASC team. If they have an idea that they want to share with us, get out your pen and start writing it down because unlike any of the other regional accrediting bodies that I have dealt with, WASC is set up to help you.”</p>
<p>WASC wants AUHS to be successful, according to Dr. Hawkins.</p>
<p>“There are other accrediting bodies that don’t really care that much about you and they would like to have you suffer,” Dr. Hawkins said, “We may suffer some but I think we’re going to succeed. God is going to make this week blossom for us.”</p>
<p>Hair Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, referred to 2 Corinthians 1:20, “For no matter how many promises God has made, they are ‘Yes’ in Christ. And so through him, the ‘Amen’ is spoken by us to the glory of God” and<br>
Numbers 23:19, “God is not a man, that he should lie.”</p>
<p>“Whatever God promises to us, He will do it. His promise can come in a form of a burning desire within us. Whatever God puts inside our heart, He will carry it to completion so that we can glorify His name,” Luong said, “Never in my life, I thought I would work in a Christian university, a university that honors God and glorifies God. And I am very grateful and blessed to be a part of what God’s plan.”</p>
<p>What makes AUHS unique is that Jesus Christ is the university’s CEO, according to Luong.</p>
<p>“I work hard not only when the people around me but even when nobody’s is there because Jesus is our CEO and He is watching over me all the time,” Luong said, “God is wonderful. He knows what you want and He knows how to make your dreams come true. For the (SON candidates) who are here, I know that you have a dream. We at AUHS are glad and we are blessed to be a part of helping you pursue your dream and helping you fulfill it.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>His Name</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>He has given you</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>What you need</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Prepared ingredients</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Fine indeed</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>He has made a place</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>For it to show</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>That all the World</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Might come to know</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>His name</em></p>
<p>Dr. Myrna Dial, the AUHS Dean of School of Nursing, reminded her colleagues and SON candidates that God always comes first.</p>
<p>“I usually come here early in the morning when the hallway is dark. There are no lights so I flip the switches on. Then I think about how much little time I have in my hands,” Dr. Dial said, “But there’s one important thing that we all need to understand. No matter what we do in life, God is always behind the scenes. Take comfort in that, especially at a time like this when we are all so busy. Do not forget that it all begins with God.”</p>
<p>God is the beginning and the end of all things. God will bless you and God will test you but He will never abandon you.</p>
<p>“We all have so many things that need to get done but a wise man stops long enough to call out to God and remember that all things are made possible through Christ,” said Pastor Johnson, “Whenever you get to the point that you become so busy that you don’t take time to honor God, then you have already started to become lost. God completes those promises, God makes these promises come true and it’s only right to honor Him.”</p>

 Women in the Bible,https://news.auhs.edu/women-in-the-bible/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Chantal Jura, AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“One thing we can be sure of is that here at AUHS, there are more women than men,” Jura said, “I did some research about women in the Bible. There are some very strong women in the Bible but it was hard to find some very empowering verses, especially in the Old Testament. Being a woman today in the 21st century is an interesting thing because we’re not like our grandmothers who had to toil the soil in a figurative sense. But we have to do that, have a job, and raise the children. The whole Feminist Movement empowered women but also gave us more work.”</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a&nbsp; personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Hail Mary, full of grace </em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>the Lord is with thee.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Blessed art thou among women </em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us sinners,</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>now and at the hour of our death</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the AUHS Vice President of Operations, explained that this verse was a prayer called, “Hail Mary” and it was one of the prayers Catholics recited while praying the rosary.</p>
<p>“There is five sets of 10 beads in the rosary that you pray the ‘Hail Mary,’ so you say it a total of 50 times,” Dr. Uvero said, “Every time you recite it, you just have to think about the power of that prayer and reflect on the power of women.”</p>
<p>Dr. Marilyn Uvero explained the reason why it was important to pray to the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>“(The Virgin Mary) is our mother and no matter what happens to us in our lives, we always run to our Mother,” Dr. Uvero said, “I can say that in my personal life, I was very close to my mom. I had to give up a job for my mom. For us women, we always look after our children as well.”</p>
<p>Kristen Soegeng, an AUHS Clinical Instructor, shared her love and admiration for her grandmother and how she was blessed by her grandmother’s prayers.</p>
<p>“My grandmother means a lot to me. Her prayer power is super strong. God listens to all of us but whatever she prays for happens,” Soegeng said.</p>
<p>When Soegeng was a new graduate nurse, she was scheduled to have a phone interview for a hospital in Texas. Her Grandmother did not want Soegeng to move out of California.</p>
<p>“My grandmother said, ‘I don’t want you to get that job. I don’t even want you to answer the phone. I’ve been praying that you don’t get the job,’” Soegeng said, “15 minutes before the phone interview, the hospital called and told me that they had already filled the position.”</p>
<p>Soegeng soon learned that everything happened for a reason.</p>
<p>“It was meant to be because instead of working (in Texas), I worked in Los Alamitos Medical Center and I met my husband there,” Soegeng said, “But if it wasn’t for my grandma looking out for me, and having that close relationship with God, I wouldn’t be where I am today.”</p>
<p>Dr. Sue Morrison, an AUHS BSN Faculty, also shared that she was “really close” to her mother.</p>
<p>“My mom was just an amazing person. She was in the hospital with congestive heart failure and she was studying two different religions. She read the Bible back and forth. I forgot how many times she turned it over and started again,” Dr. Morrison said, “One of my mother’s observations was that there were women in some Middle East countries who were not given much of a contributing role. (My mother) said, ‘These countries spend all their energy putting down a whole other half when they could be spending that energy on much better things.’ We need to be able to be objective and look at the difference in income and education.”</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 2: 18-24</strong> <em>The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.” That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</em></p>
<p>Society convolutes the purpose that God intended for both men and women to have, according to Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), the Founder of AUHS.</p>
<p>“When God created the first woman, He created a perfect mate for Adam. After things got messed up in the Garden of Eden, we (men and women) started to compete,” Dr. Dang said, “A woman has her purpose and a man has his purpose. The man can’t do a woman’s purpose because that is not his purpose. That is why he is not going to be good at it. That is why we need two halves because God gave each of us different gifts.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang explained the “original purpose” that God gave to women.</p>
<p>“A woman’s purpose is for her to be the helpmate of her man. And that man is supposed to love his woman unconditionally because she is perfect for him,” Dr. Dang said, “God intended one person to be your opposite and your mirror. But when sin came into play, all of these other things happened to distract us from our purpose.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang encouraged the women in the room to never forget the health and well-being of their children.</p>
<p>“Of course there is the Feminist Movement but women have to remember that your children require your teaching. So what does that make you as a woman? It makes you a teacher, a mother, a helper, and a comforter. You are all of these things,” Dr. Dang said, “No Feminist Movement, no man movement, no patriarchy or matriarchy can tell you who you are. God tells you who you are, not any regulations or laws.”</p>
<p>A woman knows herself as a woman after she has had children, according to Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>“Whether she knows it or not, a mother has a lot of influence on her children because they look up to her,” said Dr. Dang, “Whether a mother is right or wrong, she has a lot of power.”</p>
<p>The Bible shows how God cares for women, according to Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>“God chose a woman to bring forth Jesus Christ so that all of us will have an opportunity to live in Him and through Him,” Dr. Dang said, “If God did not regard a woman, He would not have put the Son of God in a woman and had Him come out of her.”</p>
<p>Women have been honored and utilized in the Bible, said Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>“Jesus depended on women who were entrepreneurs that sold the color purple. Purple is a really expensive color and it’s a big deal for a woman to sell purple while catering to Christ,” Dr. Dang said, “Even in the Old Testament, Rebecca, was mentioned.”</p>
<p>Although women have been honored in the Old and New Testaments, there are times when a woman “listens to society so much that they put themselves down,” according to Dr. Dang. She reminded the members in the room to always look at the big picture.</p>
<p>“Most women feel that they need to be successful in order to prove their worth but it’s really about the gift that God puts in you. God is going use what you’re best at for His Glory,” Dr. Dang said, “In AUHS, we have a woman president, a woman vice president, and a woman dean. There’s a lot of women here but it’s not about gender. It’s not about being a man or a woman. We, as individuals, are only pieces of a puzzle. A puzzle piece by itself means nothing unless a puzzle is put together and becomes a beautiful picture.”</p>
<p>Men and women should not be divided because of their gender, rather, they should both work together to honor and glorify God.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 14:1 </strong><em>The wise woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down.</em></p>
<p>There were women who served as leaders in the Bible, according to Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS. Pastor Johnson referred to the Book of Judges in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>“There were women who were judges in the Bible. In Chapter 4 of the Book of Judges, a prophetess named Deborah was leading Israel at the time. She was the leader of Israel who told the captains of the armies what to do,” Pastor Johnson said, “I think a lot of times our society wants to do things that limit or take away certain people’s power. Our society wants to play people.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang reminded the people in the room to never forget who they are and what their purpose is in life.</p>
<p>“As long as we know what God’s purpose is for us, whether you’re a man or a woman, you will be happy in your own state,” Dr. Dang said “A lot of time other people tell us when to be happy. They say if you’re a woman and you don’t have three jobs, have five kids, run your own household, and build a business on the side, then you are not a successful woman. But this is not true.”</p>
<p>There are many women in the world who are satisfied with just being a mother, according to Dr. Dang. These women love being mothers and their children are well-raised.</p>
<p>“Being a mother is a job and a half. There are times when I think that being at work is easier than being a mom,” Dr. Dang said, “If that mother is happy then she fulfills her purpose.”</p>

<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) held its first “Test-Taking Strategies Workshop” for its students in Room 203 from 4-6 pm on Friday, April 28, 2017. The workshop was facilitated by Jeanetta Mastron, an AUHS Teaching Assistant. Mastron discussed several methods of how students could improve their study habits and optimize their test-taking performance. One of the key topics Mastron discussed in the workshop was “test anxiety” or one’s fear of failing the exam.</p>
<p>“Test anxiety is very normal. I don’t get it all the time but I get test anxiety when I’m not prepared for the exam,” Mastron said, “The best way to prevent test anxiety is to be prepared.”</p>
<p>Test anxiety involved a wide range of physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms, according to Mastron. A person with test anxiety could exhibit physical symptoms such as chest pains, trouble breathing, sweaty hands, headache, faintness, and fast heartbeat. An individual who has text anxiety could experience emotional symptoms such as excessive fear, disappointment, depression, anger, feelings of helplessness, and uncontrollable laughing or crying. The cognitive symptoms of test anxiety include racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, avoidance, forgetfulness, and frustration. After describing some of the common signs of test anxiety, Mastron then asked the students who attended the workshop if they had ever experienced any of these symptoms before an exam.</p>
<p>“I get a cold and sweaty feeling when I’m taking my tests,” said one AUHS nursing student, “Too many things are going in my head and I don’t know what answer to choose.”</p>
<p>Another AUHS nursing student explained that when he takes a test, he usually feels an “over-rationalization of things” which causes him to repeatedly change the answers on his test.</p>
<p>The key to preventing or alleviating one’s test anxiety is to be prepared. Mastron suggested that the students take at least five days to prepare for their tests. In her “Five Day Test Preparation Plan,” Mastron outlined the basic steps of what students had to do each day to boost their exam performance. On Day 5, (or the first day of the test preparation plan), Mastron suggested that students review their textbooks, notes, and handouts from that particular class. She encouraged students to highlight the information they need to know on the exam.</p>
<p>On Day 4 (the second day of test preparation), a student should practice what they need to know on the exam by using mnemonic techniques. A Mnemonic is a device such as a pattern of letters or associations that help one improve memorization. For example, In English, the seven coordinating conjunctions are “For,” “And,” “Nor,” “But,” “Or,” “Yet,” and “So.” If you take the first letter of each conjunction and put them together, it makes the word, “FANBOYS.” FANBOYS is a mnemonic device.</p>
<p>On Day 3, (the third day of test preparation), Mastron advised that students rewrite the information in a “brief form” or using the fewest words possible. She suggested that they use mnemonic strategies to review their written notes at least twice per day. For Day 2, Mastron encouraged students to think of questions their teacher might ask on the test. After the students had written a list of questions that they believed would be on the test, they should write down the answers as well. On Day 1, (or the day of the test), students could do some last minute review by going over the notes they had written from Day 2. A student can do their final review while eating breakfast, driving to school, or eating lunch.</p>
<p>“Just before the test, go over any information you are having difficulty remembering,” Mastron said, “While you’re taking the test, remember to remain calm and breath.”</p>
<p>Students must repeat the Five Day Preparation Plan for every test or exam they take.</p>

Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord.</em></p>
<p>From Catholics to Jehovah’s Witness, music plays an important role in Christian worship and services. Christian music expresses one’s personal and communal belief in Jesus Christ and His teachings. It is a way for believers to express their praise, love, and devotion for God. Many churches begin their sermons with hymns and gospel music such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP95V-688hc"">“Amazing Grace”</a> by John Newton, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPsgIhlYQmM"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Mary Did You Know”</a> by Mark Lowry, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzOgA2RV6Hs"">“Above All”</a> by Michael W. Smith, and much more. Here is a list of 10 interesting facts about Christian music!</p>
<ol>
<li>Music was first mentioned in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible in Genesis 4:20-21 <em>“Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. ”</em></li>
<li>Instrumental music was used to worship God in the Old Testament in 1 Chronicles 15:16 when the Ark of the Covenant was delivered to the Tabernacle. King David commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.</li>
<li>In 112 A.D. Pliny the Younger wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan, a governor in the Roman province of Bithynia (modern-day Turkey), explaining that early Christians “ were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god,” according to an article from <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/pliny.html"">org</a>.</li>
<li>Ambrose of Milan (340-397), also known as the “Father of Christian Hymnody” introduced rhymed, acapella hymns that are the basis of the hymns we have today, according to <a href=""http://www.christianuniversitiesonline.org/music-and-ministry/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">org</a>. St. Ambrose composed songs such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s1zTmNNm7I"">“O Strength and Stay”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDVPiNe5cCU"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“At the Lamb’s High Feast.”</a></li>
<li>The Gregorian Chant or “plain chant” was the church music of the Roman Catholic Church in the Medieval Ages (5th-15th Century), according to <a href=""http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06779a.htm"">org</a>. A Gregorian chant is church music sung as a single vocal line in free rhythm and a restricted scale (plainsong). It is a style developed for the medieval Latin liturgy. Examples of the Gregorian Chant include <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flzIpwrih8Q"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Dominus Illuminatio Mea”</a> (The Lord is My Light), <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlr90NLDp-0"">“Dies Irae”</a> (Day of Wrath), and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aah_ITLw3R8"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Kyrie Eleison”</a> (Lord Have Mercy).</li>
<li>In the 1100s, a French composer named Pérotin introduced polyphonic music to the church. Polyphonic music has two or more voices or instruments, each with an independent melody, but all harmonizing. Pérotin composed songs such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJxRDhejtwo"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Alleluia Nativitas,”</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJIgqQwj2m4"">“Sederunt Principes,”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI6e4Q11NeM"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Viderunt Omnes.”</a></li>
<li>William Booth (1829-1912), the Founder of The Salvation Army, used religious music to attract more people to the church, according to <a href=""http://www.christianuniversitiesonline.org/music-and-ministry/"">org</a>. Booth had a lively band play secular music set with Christian lyrics. He called it “salvation music.” Booth’s Christian songs include <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG78M7g9wRo"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Onward Christian Soldiers,”</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELNOMMHIhE"">“O Boundless Salvation,”</a> and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qydwzaeVa0"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Send the Fire.</a>”</li>
<li>Reverend Thomas Dorsey (1899-1993) created Gospel music which is African-American religious music that combined the secular blues genre to sacred Christian texts, according to <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/people/thomas_dorsey.html"">org.</a> Dorsey wrote over 400 compositions but his most well-known song is “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq7aYTVfJh4"">Take My Hand, Precious Lord</a>.”</li>
<li>Larry Norman (1947-2008) is considered the “Father of Christian Rock” which married Christian texts to secular rock ‘n’ roll, according to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/arts/music/04norman.html"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">The New York Times.</a> Some of his most beloved songs include <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-x_WyBjO6Y"">“Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music,”</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9TXKvdT3Y"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">“Why Don’t You Look Into Jesus?”</a> and, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVXJaQ19m9g"">“Knocking on Heaven’s Door.”</a> Norman was a pioneer of the 1970s “Jesus Movement” where Christian songs became more accessible to a general audience and began developing as an industry within itself, according to <a href=""https://www.thoughtco.com/the-changing-face-of-christian-music-710628"">com</a>.</li>
<li>The 1970s “Jesus Movement” led to “Jesus music” or what is now known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM), according to <a href=""http://www.musicgenreslist.com/music-inspiration/"">com</a>. CCM encompasses all genres music including Christian pop, Christian rap, Christian metal, and much more.</li>

<p>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) and American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) sends their thoughts and prayers to victims who have suffered or are suffering from sexual violence and abuse. SAAM is meant to bring awareness of sexual assault to the American public and educate people on how to prevent it, according to <a href=""http://www.nsvrc.org/saam/about"">The National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC)</a>. America observed the first SAAM in April 2001, according to the NSVRC’s website. Ever since then, the NSVRC had helped “promote national unity for SAAM activities and encouraged “interaction and feedback from across the nation” in order to “build momentum to prevent sexual violence.”</p>
<p>Sexual assault is a violation of human rights and a major public health concern that affects millions of women, men, and children. Here are 10 things you should know about sexual assault.</p>

 On the Other Side of the Road,https://news.auhs.edu/on-the-other-side-of-the-road/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Pastor Gregory Johnson, Co-founder of AUHS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a&nbsp; personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><em>We often travel to places. Going from here then to there</em></p>
<p><em>Not so much looking, talking but helping. To show we truly care</em></p>
<p><em>We at times miss the messages, “The Word,” God speaks along “The Way</em></p>
<p><em>Truly, I know it would be well for us. If we could stop long enough to pray</em></p>
<p><em>“On the Side of the Road”</em></p>
<p>Sometimes we are meant to be in a certain place and at a certain time but we are so busy that we forget to speak about God or speak words of love and encouragement to people who need it the most, according to Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), the Founder of AUHS.</p>
<p>“We are all so busy with our lives going here and there that a lot of times we miss the opportunity to really share the word of God to others,” Dr. Dang said, “We’re so busy that we miss the opportunity to speak words of encouragement to people that we meet along the way. Sometimes you are meant to be there and you don’t even know it.”</p>
<p>You never know when you are going to make a difference in another person’s life which is why we, as Christians, need to be proactive in reaching out to people.</p>
<p>“Maybe the person who you are meant to talk to needs you to give them an encouraging word or an opportunity to change their perspective,” Dr. Dang said, “Most of the time we miss seeing that because we are only thinking of what we are dealing with today. We only think about what we have to do for ourselves and the people we love.”</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not mean to be selfish but we think about ourselves more than we do about others. We worry about ourselves and our family so much that we overlook the people that are around us.</p>
<p>“We don’t think about the people we meet in the supermarket, we don’t think about what they’re going through, we don’t think about why can’t they pay for their food,” Dr. Dang said, “We don’t think about them because we’re thinking about ourselves. If you stop long enough to give someone a word of encouragement, to show them that you also care about them and not just about yourself, it can mean a lot to that person. A lot of times we think what we do for someone else is not a big deal but for that person, it is.”</p>
<p>God is always guiding us, using us as instruments to bring others closer to Christ. Sometimes the best thing you can do to fulfill God’s will is to listen.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you just have to listen instead of talk,” Said Dr. Bobbie Carter, an AUHS Nursing Faculty, member, “You don’t always have to respond and God just wants you to listen to what He wants you to do. If you just listen to Him, He’ll tell you exactly what you need to do.”</p>
<p>Hai Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, shared how he was listening to a Christian radio show on his way to work that morning and the host was talking about Billy Sunday who was a professional baseball player and great Evangelist.</p>
<p>“When Billy was a young Christian, there was someone who gave him some advice. That person said, ‘Billy if you do this, nobody will accuse you of being a backslider. Spend 15 minutes each day to listen to God, 15 minutes to talk to God, and another 15 minutes to share God with other people.’”</p>
<p>It is all a matter of listening to God. The students, faculty, and staff at AUHS are able to listen to God on a larger scale because of the university, according to Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to a student without actually listening to the student. Don’t watch a student going through something and not pray for that student. Don’t watch a student struggle and not cry out to God for them. That is not us,” Pastor Johnson said, “The more do that, the more powerful we become, the more revenue we have, the more we can do for our community, and the more we can do for each other. Everything that we do is connected to listening to God and responding.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson shared a story of how he was driving to AUHS and while he was driving along Walnut Street, he saw an industrial complex on the side of the road.</p>
<p>“So for whatever reason, because I try to listen to God, I go inside. The place I go into is an engineering place,” Pastor Johnson said, “I asked, ‘Do you do environmental stuff?’ and ‘Do you do labs?’ They said, ‘I only do labs.’ It wasn’t where I was supposed to go.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson left and drove further up the road and saw a bicycle shop.</p>
<p>“I like bikes, so maybe I’m supposed to go to the bike shop but it was closed,” Pastor Johnson said, “As I’m getting into my car, I see another place that’s called ‘B&amp;D’ and it’s some sort of engineering business.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson entered B&amp;D and found two men watching a video. He waited patiently and asked them, “Do you guys do engineering on small parts?” and one of the men replied, “Yeah. Let me get to you after I finish watching this video.”</p>
<p>“A part of me said, ‘I should leave because this is not where I’m supposed to be.’ But the other part of me said, ‘Stay.’ So I stayed,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>After the two men finished watching their video, one of the men went to Pastor Johnson and asked how he could help him. Pastor Johnson said, “I just want to find out what you do.” The man replied, “Well, we make parts for aerospace industry and for the military.” Pastor Johnson asked if the business made small parts, if they made long runs or short runs, and if they ever made medical devices.</p>
<p>“Generally, if you see someone in the corner of your eye, you are supposed to talk to that person. I don’t care if you see them in the supermarket, I don’t care if you see them in line, you’re supposed to talk to that person,” Pastor Johnson said, “I was trying to relate whatever God has me there for with what we do here at AUHS. So I’m thinking about how I’m connecting this place with what I do.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson thought that perhaps B&amp;D is connected to AUHS’ clinical research. Maybe AUHS could make some small medical devices which could be sold to pharmaceutical companies. The employee from B&amp;D said they could not make medical devices, only individual parts. Pastor Johnson then talked to him about AUHS and then they begin talking about the man’s son, Nathan.</p>
<p>“Nathan is an interesting kid because he has emotional and mental health issues. This guy doesn’t know me. I’m standing there and we’re talking about his son,” Pastor Johnson said, “And so I said, ‘Talk to UC Irvine Medical company. I know some people there. They’re really good.’ Then I said, ‘What kind of medication is he taking?’ He tells me the medication. I said, ‘I’ll have my pharmacist check on it for you.’”</p>
<p>The man opened up to Pastor Johnson and talked about his life.</p>
<p>“The guy is 70-years-old. We started talking about his journey. He was talking about how he was wild. He was talking about how he was doing drugs. He was talking about how he owns his own company. He was talking about how he was messing up and then one day he was born again,” Pastor Johnson said “The next thing I know, we’re standing in the middle his shop praying for his son, Nathan. Then he asks me, ‘What time is church on Sunday?’ ‘What’s the address?’ ‘Can I bring Nathan?’”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson explained that everything we do is connected to God.</p>
<p>“There are so many people that we meet on the side of the road, there are so many people that we encounter along the way, and we have such power,” Pastor Johnson said, “Everyone in this room has such an anointing in their life. If you exercise anointing others, you will break strongholds, you will bring down walls, you will break off people’s chains, you will open up people, you will inspire people, and you will make a difference in people’s lives.”</p>
<p>But in order to help reach out and transform others, we must answer the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>“Be cognizant of the Spirit because there are things that you have to do while you’re traveling that is along the way,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do- The Good Samaritan<br>
</strong><em>What good do all these things matter if we fail to consider what is beheld along “They Way.” For nothing is as precious to God as what we do rather than what we say.</em><strong><br>
Luke 10: 29-34 </strong><em>“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed y on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.<br>
</em></p>
<p>If someone is in pain or in need, God does not want us to leave that person behind. There are moments in our life where we are meant to help others.</p>
<p>“We all kind of focus on our own journey and we become so blinded with tunnel vision that and we don’t take into consideration the people around us that may be part of our journey,” said Stephanie Lien, ,the AUHS Librarian, “We choose to ignore others when we really shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>The moral of the story about the good samaritan is that God looks for people who are willing to help people who are suffering, according to Dr. Mok Chong, the AUHS Dean of General Education.</p>
<p>“In order for us to be a good samaritan, we really need to have the heart to do it,” Dr. Chong said, “Our mission as a university definitely reflects on the moral obligations to help others and it’s not easy. But we always have to keep doing the right thing.”</p>
<p>You need to have good intentions when you are helping others. Just like the good samaritan, we should not expect anything in return when doing a good deed.</p>
<p>“The reality is that anytime you and I do what God asks us to do, He will take care of the other stuff. Numerically, do as much as you can because the hour will come when you cannot work,” Pastor Johnson said, “So you have to be aggressive about the work because there are so many people in the world who are lost. Not everyone is like us in this room. Everyone does not have the liberty, everyone does not have have the support, everyone has not survived the crap that you and I survived.”</p>
<p>If God puts someone in front of you, it’s because he wants you to do something for that person. That person should not leave your presence without an apparent change, according to Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p>“You should feel it, you should know it, you should sense it,” Pastor Johnson said, “It doesn’t take long.”</p>
<p>Always remember that everything in life happens for a reason and God knows what is best for you. It is all a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>“It’s really coming back to recognizing who you are. If you change your perspective then you can free yourself from disparaging the things God has given you,” Pastor Johnson said, “If you disparage what God has given you, you will not get the next layer of blessings.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson explained how God’s blessings were like the layers of a cake.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of layers in the cakes that He wants to give you. You can get a single-layer cake, a double-layer cake, or a triple-layer cake. You can get layers and layers of blessings but if you don’t appreciate the layer that you have right now, you are apt not to get to the next layer,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Never take your blessings for granted.</p>
<p>“Perspective is really important because regardless of what you think, we are blessed. There are people out there who really can tell you how it feels to not to have anything. They do not to have a house, they do not to have a home, they do not to have a job, they do not to have food, they do not to have friends, and they do not have a family,” Pastor Johnson said, “We are blessed.”</p>
<p><strong>Who Do We Help- The Abandoned </strong></p>
<p><em>There may well be needs you yourself may have. An urgency that presses drives you as you go along the road. But then be mindful, to stop, to consider, to help. You have no idea what your generosity may hold.</em></p>
<p><strong>1 Samuel 30: 9-20</strong> <em>David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley, where some stayed behind. Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley, but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit.They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat- part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights. David asked him, “Who do you belong to? Where do you come from?” He said, “I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago. We raided the Negev of the Kerethites, some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag.” David asked him, “Can you lead me down to this raiding party?” He answered, “Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them.” He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. Nothing was missing: young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back. He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s plunder.”</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>We must give without expecting anything in return but we must also understand our reasons for giving to others.</p>
<p>“Doing good deeds is not just saying them, but to also understand the reason for your generosity and reflect on how important it is to give to the person that is receiving it,” said Amarri Sander, an AUHS Student Success Coordinator.</p>
<p>Carlet Lacno, the Accountant for AUHS, shared how she had unknowingly earned the trust of student who attended the university. She did not know he was a nursing student at AUHS until she saw him on campus.</p>
<p>“So I started to talking to the student and for some reason, he listened to my advice. One day he said, ‘My mom and my dad are always on my case.’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll take care of it.’ I talked to the parents and I said, ‘You better stop hounding him,’” Lacno said.</p>
<p>Children usually do not listen to their parents and will listen to non-relatives instead, according to Lacno. The student thanked Lacno for talking to his parents because when they stopped “hounding him,” He began doing really well in school and plans to graduate from AUHS this year. The parents even told Lacno that there was a big difference in his grades after he began talking to Carlet.</p>
<p>“I texted the parents, ‘Congratulations Mom and Dad! Your kid is graduating!” Lacno said, “They texted back, ‘How do you know?’ and I said, ‘Because I signed their financial clearance.’’”</p>
<p><strong>What Kindness Shown- Your Future is Inside Your Helping Others</strong></p>
<p><em>Look then to the traveler. Though their feet be soiled with grime and dust. The manner in which you treat them and even wash their feet. Might convey to God that he can trust. You with newer generational blessings</em></p>
<p><strong>Genesis 18:2-10</strong> <em>When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth, and said, “My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, please do not pass Your servant by. Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant.” And they said, “So do, as you have said.” So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it and make bread cakes.” Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf and gave it to the servant, and he hurried to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed it before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate. Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” He said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him.</em></p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there a lot of people who preach or say that they are good or they are enlightened but they fail in their actions. They do not practice what they preach,” said Aya Almukhtar, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, “The most important thing you have is your actions. The more you give the more you get it back in blessings. Even if people can’t give you back the help you gave them, you will get it back from other sources. If you are nice and kind to others then others will be nice and kind to you.”</p>
<p>We can use the things that we learn from our personal pain and suffering to help others.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the very things that you have to struggle with are the very things that people need your help with,” said Pastor Johnson, “And the reason why God chooses you is because you’re so equipped. You have the experience, you have been prepared properly, and He has chosen you to handle it.”</p>

 Bringing the Whole Tithe into the Storehouse,https://news.auhs.edu/bringing-whole-tithe-storehouse/,,Morning Dew,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6256"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23-sean-dew-300x199.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""199""><strong>Led by Dr. Mok Chong, AUHS Dean of General Education </strong></p>
<p>Candidates for AUHS’ School of Nursing (SON) program also attended the meeting. After the opening prayer, Dr. Chong explained what Morning Dew was to the candidates.</p>
<p>“Every Monday morning from 9-10 am, Pastor Gregory Johnson (the Co-founder of AUHS) has a Morning Dew meeting with his staff. We talk about the Bible, we reflect on the Word of God, and we share our life lessons. It’s a good way to start off the week,” Dr. Chong said, “Pastor Gregory is unable to make it today, which is why I’m leading this meeting.”</p>
<p>They each took turns reading the following passages out loud and discussed what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><em>He is alive!</em></p>
<p><em>We served a rising Savior, who is in our heart today</em></p>
<p><em>For the old things have passed away, behold, all things become new!</em></p>
<p>Every day is a new day because of the grace of God. It is important to always look forward and to not dwell on the past. Tomorrow is a new day!</p>
<p>“Every day we have a chance to make things new,” said Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, “It’s all about perspective. If we maintain a positive perspective and if we keep our mission and our values at the forefront of our lives, every day we have a chance to start over. Every day we have a chance to grow and develop and every day we have a chance to be excited about our lives.”</p>
<p>Dr. Chong then discussed how the verse was about Easter Sunday and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>“Yesterday was Easter Sunday and there was a lot of people at my church. I have always liked Easter because that is when Jesus was resurrected. His resurrection gave us the power to overcome death,” Dr. Chong said, “Only with God’s power we can do so much more.”</p>
<p>Hai Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, shared how he and his family ate chicken curry on Easter Sunday. Luong grew up in Vietnam and his family raised chickens. Then every Easter Sunday and Christmas, his family would have chicken curry to celebrate. Luong also reflected on the meaning of Jesus’ resurrection and how he was able to come to terms with death.</p>
<p>“As I was growing up in Vietnam, I watched many people die in my village. When I was a kid, there was a deep, dark sadness inside of me. I saw my grandfather on my mom’s side pass away,” Luong said, “In Vietnam, we would set off these firecrackers during funerals. Before they took my grandfather’s coffin out of the house, they lit a firecracker and out came a banner that said, ‘Goodbye forever!’ The message was eternal separation.”</p>
<p>When he was a child, Luong was not a Christian so he believed that he would never see his grandfather again. When he got a bit older, Luong’s grandfather on his father’s side passed away. But it was different because his grandfather was Christian.</p>
<p>“I felt that there was a difference because I knew I would see my grandfather in heaven. We would not be separated forever,” Luong said, “And I know now that Jesus died and came back to life so that he could give us life. He gave us a new beginning. He gave us hope.”</p>
<p><strong>Malachi 3:10-12 </strong><em>Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it. I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,” says the LORD Almighty. “Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land,” says the LORD Almighty.</em></p>
<p>The Lord always provides. He is always there for you as long as you believe.</p>
<p>“God will make sure that everything you need will be given to you at the right time,” said Amarri Sanders, and AUHS Student Success Coordinator, “I like that it says, ‘the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe.’ I think this goes back to timing and as long as you’re on God’s time, you will be okay.”</p>
<p>Everything that you have does not compare to what God can provide for you.</p>
<p>“Give all that you have to God because He’s going to bless you ten times more than you can imagine,” said Cynthia Chambers, an AUHS Financial Aid Adviser.</p>
<p>Carlet Lacno, the AUHS Accountant, shared with the room how she struggled to provide her daughters with an education at a private Catholic school.</p>
<p>“My daughters are a year apart so I had to pay two tuitions all the time, to the point where I maxed out all my credit cards. I kept telling myself, ‘It’s okay, I’m paying for their security and I’m paying for them to be closer to God,’” said Lacno, “And indeed, God provides. I was able to send them to Catholic school even though I couldn’t really spend anything for myself.”</p>
<p>Lacno said she had to make many sacrifices in order to help her daughters receive a “Catholic education.” Lacno admitted that when she attended parties, she would take food to go so that she could use it as a meal for tomorrow. But Lacno’s hard work and sacrifice paid off when her daughters graduated from college.</p>
<p>“When my daughters graduated college, believe me, I was crying the loudest. When they were walking to the stage to get their diploma, one of my daughters said, ‘Mom! Stop! You’re embarrassing me!’ And I said, ‘Baby, you don’t realize how much it means to me to see you graduate,’” Lacno said, “My other daughter told me, ‘Mommy, I want to get my Master’s degree,’ and I said, ‘Oh dear. This is why I still need to work.”</p>
<p><strong>Luke 6:38</strong> <em>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”<strong><br>
</strong></em></p>
<p>“God certainly expects us to do our part. Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse. I have been obsessing with the fishes and the loaves story in the bible because whatever we need, somehow, God will make it happen,” Dr. Ryan said, “But we have to do our part. We can’t just sit back and wait. We can’t just sit back and think it will somehow it will magically come down from heaven. We have to do our part and so long as we’re working hard and as long as we’re giving it our all, God will certainly provide us with what we need. ”</p>
<p>Dr. Chong agreed that everyone in the university had to work collectively to make sure the University and its many students become successful.</p>
<p>“It’s just like Dr. Ryan said, bring the whole tithe into the storehouse. We’re not asking you to bring money, we’re asking you to bring your talent, your effort, and your time into AUHS,” Dr. Chong said, “This is a house of God. We have to bring love into it, we have to bring patience into it, we have to bring perseverance into it. If you don’t bring all that you have, heaven will not open. We are in a place where heaven is opening and we have the opportunity to bless and uplift others.”</p>

 Spiritual Growth and New Beginnings,https://news.auhs.edu/spiritual-growth-new-beginnings/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Ivy Javaluyas, the Director of Student Affairs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our topic for today is new beginnings. No matter what we’re going through in life, know that there is always hope for a better tomorrow,” Javaluyas said, “Even as an institution, whatever we go through, God will always be there for us.”</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a&nbsp; personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 29:11 “</strong><em>For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”</em></p>
<p>“One of the lessons that I have learned growing up is if I’m going through crap, it’s because God is trying to give me fertilizer. If God is giving me fertilizer, that means He’s trying to make me bear fruit,” said Pastor Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS, “If you want to see really good fruit, then you need really good fertilizer. You need manure, not chemical fertilizer. You need really good organic manure. Organic manure can come from people, it can come from circumstances, and it can come from different directions.”</p>
<p>The most powerful organic manure you have comes from situations that you did not anticipate, according to Pastor Johnson. Sometimes an unexpected downfall, failure, or tragedy is what you need to motivate and propel you to the next level. Those are the kind of situations that God uses to take us to the highest point.</p>
<p>“If my mother and little brother had not died, I would not have been born again. If I hadn’t lost everything, I would not have been born again. I would not have met my wife (Dr. Dang) and I would not be sitting here today. So God is Good. His plans for us are bigger and better than anything we can ever imagine.”</p>
<p>Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, agreed with Pastor Johnson that we sometimes need to be put in a negative situation in order to achieve and personal and spiritual growth.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the change needs to be propelled by the negative because if we’re comfortable, we just stand still,” Dr. Ryan said, “If we’re sitting comfortably, we don’t change, we don’t grow, we don’t explore, and we don’t reach beyond ourselves. We just exist.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.) shared how her house was “tented” for fumigation and was concerned about her plants. She had a rare and beautiful bougainvillea that she had for eight years. She asked the fumigator if her plant was going to die.</p>
<p>“I knew that my plant was going to die before I even asked him,” Dr. Dang said, “Most of the time we already know what the answer is but we do it anyway.”</p>
<p>The fumigator told Dr. Dang, “As long as you water it a lot the day before, soak it, and do whatever you need to do to make sure that the water goes deep down into the roots, then it’s going to survive.” Dr. Dang took his advice and she “literally drowned it” with water.</p>
<p>“After the fumigation, the tent was removed and my plant looked dead. But the old leaves had to die for the new leaves to spring up,” Dr. Dang said, “When I started to see life, I went out and bought fertilizer. The point being is that I had to ask for advice first. There are some things we know that’s just not good for us but we just do it anyway, pretending that we don’t know any better.”</p>
<p>Before we do something that will cause us harm, always turn to God for guidance.</p>
<p>“Ask God for advice and He will open another door for us so that we will not be drowned in our mess. The fumigator told me to water the plant and if I didn’t ask, I wouldn’t have known any better, and my plant would have died,” Dr. Dang said, “My plan is eight years old and I cannot get it in that color anymore. Now it’s blooming great and it’s even more alive!”</p>
<p><strong>1 Peter 5:10 </strong><em>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.</em></p>
<p>“It ties right into the fact that sometimes we do have to suffer, sometimes we do have to feel less than comfortable in order to be born again, in order to be called to a greater purpose under God,” said Dr. Ryan, “And as quickly as we can get to feeling restored, confirmed, strengthened, and established, then we are likely to suffer a little more and be called into a greater challenge and to keep on growing. No matter what we’re going through today, there is a brighter tomorrow.”</p>
<p>God does not put you through a situation that He does not think you can handle or grow from.</p>
<p>“It seems like everyone goes through trials and tribulations but when you think about it, it’s all really part of God’s plan. He’s the only one who really knows when and why you are going through this,” said Brian Cuffey, an AUHS maintenance man, “That’s when it’s time for you to sit there and grow because that’s exactly what He wants you to do.”</p>
<p>Personal and spiritual growth not only has to do with your circumstances but your perspective on life.</p>
<p>“We pray to God to change our circumstances but a lot of the times your circumstances have not changed, you changed,” Dr. Dang said, “You changed so your circumstances looks different now than it did before. When you go to God for help, He gives us the opportunity to change ourselves so that our circumstances do not seem so bad anymore, the problem does not seem so great anymore, and we have more peace. We look at our situation differently because put our faith and trust in God.”</p>

 Saving Sinners,https://news.auhs.edu/saving-sinners/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Dr. Mok Chong, Dean of General Education</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Today we’re going to talk about God and how His son, Jesus Christ, came into this world to save us,” Dr. Chong said.</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a&nbsp; personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Luke 15: 1-5 </strong><em>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” Then Jesus told them this parable: “Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders.”</em></p>
<p>“The Pharisees and the religious authorities in those days did not like Jesus because he was radically different,” said Hai Luong, an Admissions Coordinator, “Jesus hung around with sinners, the tax collectors, the IRS (Internal Service Revenue).”</p>
<p>Luong explained that the tax collectors in those days were worse than the IRS today because although the tax collectors were Jewish and part of the community, they worked for the Romans and for their own self-interest.</p>
<p>“The tax collectors were blood sucking people who collected more than what was due because whatever extra they collected, they put in their own pocket,” Luong said, “The Jewish people were already oppressed. The Romans came and took over their country and the tax collectors put even more of a burden on their shoulders.”</p>
<p>But one of Jesus’ 12 Disciples was a tax collector named Levi. When Jesus “recruited him,” Levi changed his name to Matthew, according to Luong.</p>
<p>“When Matthew became a Disciple, he threw a party and invited sinners and his tax collector friends. Then Jesus came to the party and talked to them,” Luong said, “The Pharisees and the authorities did not like this. They despised how Jesus welcomed sinners and ate with them.”</p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS, discussed how Christians today should follow Jesus’ example of reaching out to sinners and bringing them closer to God.</p>
<p>“A lot of times we get to a place where we think that just because we’re saved, we have finished the work that is before us,” said Pastor Johnson, “But actually our work has only just begun because God saved us to save others and to be used as instruments to help bring others to Christ.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson discussed his experience in Wondercon at the Anaheim Convention Center from March 31- April 2, 2017. He and his associates held a booth at the event, passed out flyers, talked about AUHS’ nursing program, and prayed for attendees. While Pastor Johnson was inside the Anaheim Convention Center “creating a space for God,” there were Christians outside holding signs and protesting the event.</p>
<p>“We (AUHS) were at Wondercon and it was a place where religious folk will not go. In fact, they stand outside, protesting and hitting people with signs. But I’m inside inviting people to Christ,” Pastor Johnson said, “I think a lot of times what people do in their enthusiasm is that they forget about who they were and how they have also sinned. They forget how far away they were from Christ.”</p>
<p>Most people will not come closer to “the cross” through “legalization” and “the commandments,” according to Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p>“The cross symbolizes an invitation of love. It is an invitation from Jesus to come and be with Him forever because He loved us so much that He died for us,” Pastor Johnson said, “The bottom line is we have been saved so that we can save others. We have been anointed so that we could heal others. We have been gifted so we can use our gifts to glorify God.”</p>
<p>Just as Jesus Christ was willing to walk among sinners, Christians must do the same.</p>
<p>“You have to be willing to go out, you have to be willing to go to the highways and to the byways where people are at and where people are lost because that’s where we can begin,” Pastor Johnson said, “All of us are unclean. All of us are lepers. And if we were lepers (in Jesus’ time), the Pharisees would not have been able to touch us, speak to us, or save us. So when you get to the point where you are so religious that you do not want to touch a leper, then you have already become confused. All of us are unclean and the only person that can clean us is Christ.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), the Founder of AUHS, offered a different point of view regarding the Christians holding signs outside of Wondercon. She believed that the Christians were not protesting but were actually using the event to reach out to people and bring them closer to God.</p>
<p>“Hundreds and thousands of people go to Comicon and Wondercon. I always see people laugh at the Christians standing outside. They think that (the Christians) are a joke or that they’re lunatics. People want to go to Comicon to have a good time and they think these Christians are coming in with signs and bullhorns, trying to ruin it,” Dr. Dang said, “But what the Christians are trying to say is, ‘Hey listen, what you have here is temporary. What happens after you die is forever. Being with God is forever. Eternity is a long time, so you want to be in a good place.’”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang expressed her admiration for the Christians who held signs outside of Wondercon.</p>
<p>“I really admire those guys because even though people ridicule them, they still care about you enough to want to save you,” Dr. Dang said, “A lot of&nbsp; Christians don’t want to go out in public and be mocked but for some reason, they felt a need or desire to save these people. What they’re doing is brave because a lot of people don’t want to be laughed at or made fun of, but they took that risk for Christ.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang though it was interesting that these Christians opted to use Wondercon as a venue to preach the Gospel.</p>
<p>“Traditionally Christians went door to door to tell people about God. Today, the only ones who knock on doors are Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormons,” Dr. Dange said, “I’m so impressed by how good they are it. There are boys as young as 16-years-old, riding their bikes through bad neighborhoods, and knocking on doors. They are so committed. How do they get their kids to become that committed? Why are we as Christians sometimes are committed and sometimes are not?”</p>
<p><strong>John 3:17 </strong><em>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.</em></p>
<p>“What does a sinner do? Sin. Our flesh is very weak so we continue to sin. But God comes for all of us and by His grace, we are saved,” Dr. Chong said, “The beauty of Jesus is that He does not care what class you are, how much money you have, or whether or not you’re a doctor. None of those things matter because Jesus knows we are not perfect and He still loves us anyway.”</p>
<p>Dr. Chong asked the people in the room to consider the university’s mission and how it is connected to the Lord’s will.</p>
<p>“We at the university accepts everybody. We give everybody a chance. Our mission at AUHS is very important because we represent the teachings of Christ- to love one another and to save as many people as possible,” Dr. Chong said, “It does not matter if a student has 3 kids, she can still come back to school. There are people who do not get into any of the other school they applied to but AUHS gives them a chance. We are looking for people who want to provide the kind of love and care to their patients the same way Christ has loved and cared for us.”</p>
<p>Luong explained that God’s standards towards us are higher than our own personal standards.</p>
<p>“The word ‘sin’ in Greek means ‘to miss the mark.’ God expects perfection and none of us is perfect. We have all missed that mark of perfection,” Luong said, “God’s standards are much higher than our own standards and that is why the Bible is for all of us who sin and had fallen short of His glory. Jesus, who was perfect, came to die in our place to fulfill God’s law of perfection and holiness. We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson explained that not all sinners sin intentionally and it was their responsibility as Christians to teach sinners that what they are doing is wrong.</p>
<p>“The gospel opens our own eyes so that we can see and you do not see a problem until you get closer to something that is clear,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>He explained that when a boy grows up to become a young man, he will think about making love to a woman. The young man may not necessarily think that making love to a woman is fornication.</p>
<p>“If they think it’s just making love and they haven’t drawn closer to Christ, they won’t see it as a problem,” Pastor Johnson said, “When you have become enlightened, and you have become educated, and when God reveals His true nature to you, you will have clarity. Then you will realize the things that once were okay are not okay anymore.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson explained that it is important for Christians to invite everyone to God but in the end, they cannot decide that person’s fate.</p>
<p>“We can’t decide who God saves but you can’t just let people sin if you love them. It does a disservice and it’s not right. But you have to do it in love, you have to say it in love, you have to offer it in love,” Pastor Johnson said, “In fact, it says in the bible, if you see a man falling and you don’t warn him, he not only dies in his sins, but you as well. But if you see a man falling, and you warn him, his death is on his own hands and not on yours.”</p>

<p><strong>2 Timothy 13:16-17</strong> <em>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</em>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) was invited to attend the BSN/MSN Education Fair at Cedars-Sinai on Monday, April 10, 2017, from 7 am to 2:30 pm. Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliations, and Aya Almukhtar, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, held a booth at Cedars-Sinai on the university’s behalf. Jura and Almukhtar passed out informational packets and spoke to many people who were interested in receiving their Master’s or Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing degree.</p>
<p>“This was the first time we were invited to Cedars-Sinai’s Education Fair. It was a fun event. They provided breakfast and lunch and we got to mix and mingle with the Cedars-Sinai education department,” Jura said, “This was a great way for AUHS to reach out to prospective students and for Cedars-Sinai get to know us better.”</p>
<p>Over 30 people visited AUHS’ booth to take a flyer, ask questions about what programs the university had to offer, and filled out applications.</p>
<p>“A lot of the people that I spoke to were interested in our Master in Clinical Research (MSCR) program and our Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing (BSN) program,” Jura said, “There were even some people who approached us that were not necessarily nurses but were in a related field, like Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA), who wanted to become nurses because of their work experience.”</p>
<p>About a dozen universities attended Cedars-Sinai’s BSN/MSN Education Fair including West Coast College (WCC), California State University Long Beach (CSULB), University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and Arizona State University (ASU). What set AUHS apart from the rest of the other universities was its Christian values and extensive community outreach events such as <a href=""/2017/04/11/spring-2017-acts-love/"">Acts of Love</a>, <a href=""/2016/12/14/auhs-gives-gifts-matter/"">Santa Cause</a>, and <a href=""/2017/01/31/pray-forward-epiphany/"">Pray it Forward</a>.</p>
<p>“A lot of people were interested in the fact that AUHS was a Christian university,” Jura said, “We appealed to other Christians who shared the same values. They liked how we give our students opportunities to help the homeless and make a real difference in the community.”</p>
<p>AUHS plans to attend a similar event at Harbor UCLA on May 2nd, 2017.</p>
<p>AUHS is a private, for-profit, minority owned, minority serving, Christian-based university whose mission is to educate and equip students with life careers and to produce quality health care professionals for the community, the nation, and the world.

 10 Facts About Alcoholism,https://news.auhs.edu/10-facts-alcoholism/,,Articles,"<p><strong><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright wp-image-6225"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alcoholism-Awareness-Month-300x169.png"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""225"">Proverbs 20:1 </strong><em>Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise.</em></p>
<p>April is Alcoholism Awareness Month and American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) encourages people to practice moderation, find strength and courage to abstain from drugs and alcohol, and to seek treatment for addiction. We pray that those who suffer from alcohol and drug addiction will find love, forgiveness, and a renewed mind through Christ so that they may begin their road to recovery.</p>
<p>Alcohol Awareness Month was established in 1987 by the <a href=""https://www.ncadd.org/about-ncadd/events-awards/alcohol-awareness-month"">National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc. (NCADD)</a> to encourage the American public to seek information about alcohol, to understand the consequences of alcoholism, and learn how one can recover from alcohol addiction. Alcohol Awareness Month provides a “focused opportunity” to “decrease stigma and misunderstandings (of alcoholism) in order to dismantle the barriers to treatment and recovery” and “make seeking help more readily available to those who suffer from this disease,” according to the NCADD’s official website.</p>
<p>Drinking too much alcohol can take a serious toll on your body. Here is a list of 10 facts about alcoholism and how consuming excessive amounts of alcohol can negatively impact your health.</p>
<ol>
<li>Excessive alcohol use accounts for 88,000 deaths each year, according to Risky alcohol use is common in America. 29% of adults in the U.S. consume too much alcohol, according to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/alcohol-screening.html"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. More than 38 million Americans binge drink, and on average they do it four times a month and drink 8 drinks per occasion.</li>
<li>Drinking irresponsibly or risky alcohol use is costly. In 2010, risky alcohol use cost the United States about $249 billion, according to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/alcohol-screening.html"">CDC</a>.</li>
<li>80 percent of criminals abuse drugs or alcohol and nearly 50 percent of jail and prison inmates are clinically addicted, according to <a href=""https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/alcohol-drugs-and-crime"">NCADD</a>.</li>
<li>Every day, roughly 30 people in America dies in motor vehicle crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver. This amounts to one death every 51 minutes, according to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/Motorvehiclesafety/Impaired_Driving/index.html"">CDC</a>.</li>
<li>Women who binge drink are more likely to have unprotected sex and multiple sex partners which increase the risks of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), according to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/womens-health.htm"">CDC</a>.</li>
<li>Alcohol disrupts the brain’s communication pathways and can affect the way the brain looks and works, according to the <a href=""https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/alcohols-effects-body"">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)</a>. These interruptions can change one’s mood and behavior, making it difficult to think clearly and move with coordination.</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol can weaken your immune system, making your body vulnerable to disease, according to NIAAA. Chronic drinkers are more susceptible to pneumonia and tuberculosis than occasional drinkers.&nbsp; Drinking excessively on a single occasion will slow your body’s ability to ward off infections up to 24 hours after getting drunk.</li>
<li>Heavy drinking damages the liver and can lead to a variety of problems and liver inflammations including steatosis or “fatty liver”, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.</li>
<li>Drinking alcohol in excess can increase your risk of developing certain cancers, including cancers of the mouth, esophagus, throat, liver, and breast.</li>
<li>Overtime, alcohol abuse can damage the heart, causing problems such as cardiomyopathy- the stretching and drooping of the heart muscle, arrhythmias- irregular heartbeat, stroke, and high blood pressure.</li>
</ol>

 God and Time,https://news.auhs.edu/god-time/,,Morning Dew,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6221"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/526602-1-300x191.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""191""><strong>Led by Pastor Gregory Johnson, Co-founder of AUHS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>While precious are the finest jewels, more precious is our time</em></p>
<p><em>For we are on a mission and the cause we have divine</em></p>
<p>Time is God’s gift to us so it must be cherished and used wisely.</p>
<p>“I believe that time is the most precious thing we have. It represents our life, our future, what we’ve done, and what we can still do. If we do not have time, then we have nothing,” said Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, “Oftentimes we find ourselves wasting time or being unproductive. We need to use our time deliberately.”</p>
<p>There must be balance and moderation in life. We must know when to use our time for relaxation, work, family, and prayer. We must be deliberate on how we spend our time because once we run out of time, we cannot get it back.</p>
<p>“Time is more precious than money or material things,” said Dr. Mok Chong, the Dean of General Education, “We can still make money and buy more things but you can never get time back. We need to be diligent and use our time wisely.”</p>
<p>Dr. Chong explained how he had recently received an email from a former AUHS nursing student, thanking him for being there for her. Dr. Chong had written a letter of recommendation for the AUHS graduate and she now worked at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.</p>
<p>“It was so nice to get that email,” Dr. Chong said, “Time is the most important thing that we have because we can use it to make a difference in the lives of as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson shared with the room that his eldest son, Gregory, was going to be 20-years-old.</p>
<p>“When Gregory was a child, we used to take care of him in our office. He would just roll around in a walker because we couldn’t afford a babysitter. Students would just come in and play with him,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson emphasized the importance of spending time with family.</p>
<p>“The time that we spend time with our children is really God’s time. Our time with our children should remind them of their own destiny,” Pastor Johnson said, “While we play with our children, we can tell them, ‘You are wonderfully made,’ ‘I love you,’ and ‘You are precious.’”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson shared how he saw a Jewish family at a Coffee Bean that day. He glanced at them, went to the manager, handed him money and said, “Whatever they’re buying, use this.” Pastor Johnson tried to leave before the family noticed his deed but one of the family members walked up to him and said, “You didn’t have to do that.” Pastor Johnson replied, “God wanted me to do it because you have a beautiful family.”</p>
<p>“Everything that we do is connected to our mission in this world. There is absolutely no disconnect,” Pastor Johnson said, “Our business is about telling as many people possible that time and God are real. Our business is to influence as many people as possible and tell them that the life that they are leading is precious in the eyes of God.”</p>
<p>If AUHS faculty and staff do their job with fervor, with diligence, and with intent, they have the power to influence many people on many different levels and be blessed in the process, according to Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p>“Our time with God is precious because if we don’t have time with God, we don’t have any strength. You can be the greatest business person in the world but if you don’t love your family, you don’t have anything,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Never take your true friends for granted.</p>
<p>“Our time with our friends is precious because real friends are hard to come by. In our world today, we use the word ‘friends’ all the time because of Facebook and other social media.&nbsp; But true friends are rare. Love them,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson urged AUHS faculty and staff to not only love their family and friends but to love their co-workers as well.</p>
<p>“We, (AUHS faculty and staff), spend more time together in our waking hours than we do with anyone else in the world,” Pastor Johnson said, “We need to love and pray for each other.”</p>
<p>Hai Luong, an Admissions Coordinator, referred to Psalm 90:12- “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.”</p>
<p>“Time is a gift that God gives to all of us and how we spend that time is our gift back to God,” Luong said.</p>
<p><strong>Not Waste</strong></p>
<p><em>Let me not waste a second, to fulfill what needs be done</em></p>
<p><em>Let all my work be diligent, as proffered to “The Son” </em></p>
<p>What makes AUHS unique from every other university is that God is in the center of everything it does. AUHS has a cause and a divine mission.</p>
<p>“If we know that we have a divine mission, it changes the whole context, color, and flavor of what it is that we are doing in this university,” said Dr. Ryan, “If we put it in the context of a divine mission, whether it’s creating learning outcomes or balancing a spreadsheet, all of these pieces go into changing people’s lives and training people to go out into the world to do really great things. If we put all of that into perspective, I think we will be able to value our time more and make us appreciate the things each of us has contributed to the university. There is no task that is unworthy.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson urged the members of the room to always persevere and strive for excellence.</p>
<p>“Our faith should imply that we are excellent, our faith should imply that we are on our game, our faith should imply that when people look at everything that we do, every detail speaks of honoring God,” Pastor Johnson said, “You can’t say you love God and be halfway in what you do.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson referred to the Book of Genesis where two brothers, Cain and Abel, gave burnt offerings to God. God accepted Abel’s offering but rejected Cain’s.</p>
<p>“God loved Abel’s offering but there something was amiss with Cain’s offering. Maybe Cain took too long to put it together, but there was something about his offering that did not please God,” Pastor Johnson said, “Anything that we do should please and honor God.”</p>

<p><strong>John 13:13-15</strong> <em>“You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</em></p>
<p>15 nursing students from American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) volunteered to wash the feet of homeless individuals at the Second Samoan Church in Long Beach, California from 12- 2 pm on Thursday, April 13, 2017. This annual community outreach event was called “Lamp Unto My Feet” and observed how Jesus washed the feet of His Disciples in the Last Supper. About 60 attendees were given a free health screening, lunch, $5 donation, foot cleaning, and a pair of new socks. Students arrived at the church’s parking lot as early as 10 in the morning to help pitch the tents, set up the chairs, arrange a snack table, lay down fresh towels, and fill plastic tubs with soap and water.</p>
<p>AUHS nursing student Ryan Albano from Cohort 13 patiently waited outside the front door of the church with a pen and clipboard in hand, inviting churchgoers to the event.</p>
<p>“You have to understand that there are people in this world who are not fortunate enough to have good health. Since we, (the students), have good health, we need to use it to do something meaningful for the community,” Albano said, “Lamp Unto My Feet shows the (homeless) community that people still care about them.”</p>
<p>Albano helped sign in attendees such as Melvin Carr, a decorated veteran who was a machine gunner for the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War. Carr suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and had been in and out of homelessness throughout his life. He could not afford to rent an apartment and would often find shelter in hotels. Carr had recently become homeless about 2 weeks prior.</p>
<p>“Now you (the students) are all lucky that I took a shower yesterday and put on some clean socks and shoes,” Carr said, grinning, “A little bit of humor doesn’t hurt but the main reason why I came to Lamp Unto My Feet is because I’m homeless right now.”</p>
<p>Carr was going through a difficult time in his life and needed every bit of help that he could get. The church had always supported Carr during his time of need.</p>
<p>“You can talk to the Pastor and he can help refer you somewhere. He prays for me and it helps,” Carr said, “God has always been there for me. When I went to Vietnam, He helped bring me back home alive. I’m still breathing and even though I need a cane, I’m still walking.”</p>
<p>In the morning, hours before the event officially began, students had the opportunity to meet with dozens of homeless people inside the Second Samoan Church. AUHS nursing students took surveys on the participants’ physical and mental health conditions as well as their access to healthcare services and medicine. Students then provided attendees with essential healthcare information and resources. They even informed participants of a variety of clinics and health care programs available in the local area.</p>
<p>“This morning, the students asked the homeless some questions about their health. They were all very simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions,” said AUHS nursing student Inell Adams from Cohort 19, “I’ve learned that a lot of people are homeless for various reasons. They all had a story to tell.”</p>
<p>Adams remembered speaking to a 39-year-old woman who was “borderline homeless.”</p>
<p>“Her boyfriend was under the influence of illegal drugs and struck her on the side of the head. There was brain damage and ever since then, she hasn’t been right,” Adams said.</p>
<p>Adams hoped that the information she gathered from the survey will help AUHS and the Second Samoan Church better understand the needs of the homeless community in Long Beach. She also hoped that the health care information she had provided to participants would encourage them to seek the medical attention they needed.</p>
<p>After the survey, attendees were invited to the Second Samoan Church’s parking lot for AUHS’ Lamp Unto My Feet. Dozens of homeless individuals lined-up in the Second Samoan Church’s parking lot for the event. Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS, attended the event to wash the first person’s feet and gave $5 to each guest. Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), the Founder of AUHS, was also present at the event. She wore a black apron over her dress and helped AUHS students wash the feet of homeless individuals.</p>

<p>73-year-old Robert Lee was “looking in the dumpsters” behind the church when he saw the AUHS students preparing for the event in the parking lot. After seeing the students hard at work, Lee decided to attend.</p>
<p>“I think Lamp Unto My Feet is so beautiful. The students that came here today are so great,” Lee said, “This event reminds me of how Mary Magdalene washed Jesus’ feet with her tears and hair.”</p>
<p>Lee suffered from gout and he was touched that the AUHS students were willing to wash his feet.</p>
<p>“I have gout on both toes. I used to love tuna, it was my favorite food. But if I eat seafood, I wouldn’t be able to walk. The pain makes me feel like a puppet on a string,” Lee said, “I want you to know from the deepest part of my old heart that I really appreciate the great work AUHS did today.”</p>

 10 Interesting Facts About Easter,https://news.auhs.edu/10-interesting-facts-easter/,,Articles,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6207"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Easter-greeting-2017-300x169.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169"">From all of us at American University of Health Sciences (AUHS), Happy and blessed Easter Sunday! Easter is the most important Christian holiday because it observes the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus that humanity became reconciled with God. Easter Sunday marks the last day of Lent, a 40 day period where Christians fast, pray and seek penance in observance of how Jesus went into the desert to be tempted by the devil before he began his ministry. Here are ten interesting facts that you probably didn’t know about Easter!</p>
<ol>
<li>Easter is called a “moveable feast” because it does not have a set date every year, according to <a href=""http://www.history.com/topics/holidays/history-of-easter"">com.</a> Christian churches in the West celebrate Easter on the first Sunday following the full moon after the vernal equinox on March 21. Therefore, Easter is observed anywhere between March 22 and April 25 every year.</li>
<li>The week preceding Easter is called Holy Week and includes Maundy Thursday, which observes Jesus’ last supper with his disciples; and Good Friday, which honors the day He was crucified, died and was buried.</li>
<li>Holy Week is the celebrated during the week leading up to Easter. It begins on Palm Sunday, continues on to Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday and then, Easter Sunday.</li>
<li>The first story of a rabbit (which will be later known as the “Easter Bunny”) laying eggs in a garden was published in 1680.</li>
<li>“The White House Easter Egg Roll” event has been celebrated by the President of the United States and their families since 1878.</li>
<li>Egg dyes were once made out of natural items such as onion peels, tree bark, flower petals, and juices.</li>
<li>Palm Sunday is often celebrated with a procession of palm leaves. In some churches, the palms are saved and burnt into ashes to be used on Ash Wednesday of the next year.</li>
<li>According to Polish folklore, the Virgin Mary offered eggs to the soldiers guarding Christ on the cross, as she begged them to be merciful. Her tears left stains on the eggs.</li>
<li>Origins of the Easter Bunny are unclear, but he appears in early German writings.<br>
The first edible Easter bunnies appeared in Germany in the 1800s, and were made out of sugar and pastry.</li>
<li>Americans nearly $2 billion on Easter candy making it the second biggest candy holiday after Halloween. Over 90 million chocolate Easter bunnies are made each year.</li>

 Spring 2017 Nursing Orientation,https://news.auhs.edu/spring-2017-nursing-orientation/,,Event Summaries,"<div class=""mceTemp"">
<div id=""attachment_6204"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6204"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6204"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nursingorientation3-20-17-300x180.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""180""><p id=""caption-attachment-6204"" class=""wp-caption-text"">50 students attend the Spring 2017 Nursing Orientation on Monday, March 20, 2017.</p></div>
<p>American University of Health Sciences welcomed 50 students to its School of Nursing (SON) Program in the Spring 2017 Orientation on Monday, March 20, 2017. Dr. Cheryl Padgham, AUHS’ Assistant Dean of School of Nursing, welcomed incoming students to the university and gave them an in-depth presentation about the SON program, academic integrity, and the institution’s mission and culture.</p>
<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p>“We want you (incoming nursing students) to be committed to learning,” Dr. Padgham said, “Your nursing faculty is fully committed to teaching you to become excellent nurses but you have to be just as committed to learn.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham explained how the students must maintain a 2.5 GPA (grade point average) to remain in the SON program. If a student’s GPA falls below 2.5, he or she will be placed on academic probation.</p>
<p>“You will have the following quarter to bring your GPA up,” Dr. Padgham said, “But we will provide you with a lot of resources that will help you. You will not be alone in that process.”<br>
A student’s grades are “as is,” meaning their final grades will not be rounded up or down.</p>
<p>“If you get a 77.5-percent grade then you do not pass the course because that grade will not be rounded up. The grade is the grade,” she said.</p>
<p>Nursing students are only allowed to fail then retake one course throughout the entirety of the SON Program. Two failures result in dismissal from the program.</p>
<p>“If you fail one course then you have to pass that course the next time around. But you can only fail once for the entire program,” said Dr. Padgham, “If you fail a second course throughout your program here, then you are out of the SON program. So you must be successful for every course.”</p>
<p>She then discussed the terms for withdrawing from classes.</p>
<p>“Just like in any other university and in any other major, you have the ability to withdraw from a class,” Dr. Padgham said, “When you withdraw, you will get a ‘W’ for that course. Then you can come back the next time the class is taught and you can retake it.”</p>
<p>Students have until the 7th week of school to withdraw from their courses. However, students cannot withdraw from a course because of failing grades.</p>
<p>“Obviously, there are extenuating circumstances. If something unfortunate happens and you have no choice but to withdraw from a class, then speak with your clinical faculty,” Dr. Padgham said, “Communication is very important.”</p>
<p>Incoming students were then given an overview of the classes they were required to take.“The first course that you will be taking is the physical assessment class and the physical assessment lab. These are two separate courses but they are ‘linked,’ meaning that what you learn in the class, you will then apply in the lab,” Dr. Padgham said, “You will have multiple courses where you will have a theory class that is linked to a clinical course. You must pass both the theory course and the clinical course in order to advance in the program.”</p>
<p>If a student passed a theory class but did not pass the clinical rotation linked to said theory class, then the student cannot move on to the next course. The student must retake both the theory class and the clinical course again because they are linked.</p>
<p>AUHS nursing students are expected to behave professionally in both the classroom and on clinical sites.</p>
<p>“AUHS has a code of ethics and a code of conduct. The university uses the same code of ethics as professional nurses,” said Dr. Padgham, “Professional behavior means that you are here on time, you speak kindly to one another, and you do not fight or argue in the hallways. We want you to treat each other civilly.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham emphasized the importance of academic integrity.</p>
<p>“If you see cheating, collusion, or plagiarism, you are to report it,” she said, “If we, as registered nurses (RN), see another RN who is treating a patient unsafely, it is your ethical duty to report it to your supervisor. The same thing happens in a university setting.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham explained to the students that each professor or faculty member in the SON program is different and will ultimately decide what will and will not be allowed in their classroom.</p>
<p>“Some faculty will let you record their lectures but some will not. Some faculty will allow you to use your laptop during class but some faculty will not,” Dr. Padgham said, “Each faculty member has charge of their classroom.”</p>
<p>The students were advised not to use their cellphones while they are in a classroom or clinical site.</p>
<p>“The one thing that will drive any faculty crazy is if you are using your cellphone. Also, if you are in a clinical area and you take your cellphone out, a lot of the nurses on the floor will think you are texting a friend,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham acknowledged that students today have “awesome apps” on their cellphones such as drug apps and access to textbooks. But not all nurses and professors will understand what students are doing on their phones so it is best to not use their cellular devices unless they are instructed to do otherwise. She went on to discuss the essential functions of a student nurse in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>“You must be able to communicate, think critically, listen to instructions, and have fine motor abilities,” Dr. Padgham said, “You are going to be on your feet for 12-hour shift so you will be moving, lifting and turning a lot.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham informed the students of the university’s skills lab where they could practice taking blood pressure, IV starts, and more.</p>
<p>“We have an awesome skills lab, so use it! We encourage you to go in and practice what you learned in class,” she said, “But when you’re in the skills lab, you have to follow the rules- no food, no drink, etc. You can use the equipment that is available in the lab as long as you put it away when you are done.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham asked the students to be courteous to their fellow peers and SON faculty by keeping the skills lab as clean as possible.</p>
<p>“I always say that when you use the skills lab, you are going to leave it cleaner and tidier than when you came in,” Dr. Padgham said, “Leaving a mess in the skills lab is completely inappropriate and unprofessional, so please clean up after yourselves. If you find a piece of equipment that is not working, please let the faculty know so that we can get it repaired.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham also discussed how students would be graded in their clinicals.</p>
<p>“The clinical faculty will be with you in the skills lab and on clinical sites,” she said, “In your clinical courses, you do not get a letter grade. Your grade is either a pass or fail.”</p>
<p>Dr. Padgham gave the students some advice regarding their clinical rotations.</p>
<p>“You need to be on time, be in your uniform, and have all the equipment you need for that clinical site,” Dr. Padgham said, “Clinical instructors will send you home if you are late, if you do not have your appropriate uniform, and if you do not have your appropriate equipment. You do not want to be sent home because that is considered an absence.”</p>
<p>Being on time is vital in clinical rotations, according to Dr. Padgham.</p>
<p>“For those of you that end up with a 2-hour commute, give yourself enough time to get there. I tell my kids, “If you’re early, then you’re on time. If you’re on time, then you’re late. If you’re late, then just forget it,’” Dr. Padgham said, “Being on time is part of being a professional. Think about it. When you’re working as an RN, do you always want to be 10 minutes late? No, you’re going to get fired. That is why we are building that in you right now. Be on time.”</p>

" Holy Week – Remembering the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ",https://news.auhs.edu/holy-week-remembering-passion-death-resurrection-jesus-christ/,,University News,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6200"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/thelastsupper-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""216"">As Easter draws near, American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) reflects on Holy Week. Holy Week (or Passion week) is the last week of Lent and is celebrated by many Christian churches to commemorate the passion (suffering), death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is a week to prepare for Easter Sunday, which is the most important Christian holiday because it is through Christ’s sacrifice that humanity became reconciled with God.</p>
<p>Holy Week is called a “moveable feast” which mean they are holidays that occur on the same day of the week each year but does not fall on a fixed date. (For example, in 2016 Easter Sunday was on March 27th but this year, Easter will be celebrated on April 16th, 2017.)</p>
<p>From Palm Sunday to Holy Saturday, here is an overview of what Christians observe throughout Holy Week.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Palm Sunday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>John 12:12-13 </strong><em>The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! ” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”“Blessed is the king of Israel!”</em></p>
<p>Holy Week began this year on Palm Sunday on April 9, 2017. Palm Sunday is celebrated the final Sunday of Lent and it observes Jesus Christ’s triumphant return to Jerusalem in springtime, around the year 30 A.D. Jesus had spent months traveling throughout Palestine, preaching about the kingdom of God and healing the sick. Jesus came to Jerusalem claim His title as the Messiah that God had promised to the Jewish people. He was welcomed and worshiped by crowds of people who waved palm tree branches and laid their clothes before His feet.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>
<h3>Holy Monday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Matthew 21:12-13</strong> <em>Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. “It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’”</em></p>
<p>Holy Monday was celebrated this year on April 10, 2017. This day commemorates how Jesus entered the temple and found that its courts were filled with money changers and merchants selling oxen, sheep, and doves. Jesus overturned the tables, poured out the changers’ money, and drove them all out of the temple.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>
<h3>Holy Tuesday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Matthew 21:21</strong> <em>Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.</em></p>
<p>Holy Tuesday was celebrated this year on April 11, 2017. This day observes how Israel’s religious authorities challenged Jesus, questioning His right to cleanse the temple, among other things. The Pharisees made attempts to force Jesus to state that He had divine power from God so that He could be charged with blasphemy and even arrested. When their attempts failed, the chief priests plotted to have Jesus crucified. The chief priests conspired with Judas, one of the 12 Disciples, and paid him 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>
<h3>Maundy Thursday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>John 13: 13-15</strong> <em>“You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. 15I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</em></p>
<p>Maundy Thursday was observed this year on April 13, 2017. On this day, Christians remember The Last Supper, when Jesus celebrated the final Passover with His Disciples. In The Last Supper, Jesus washed the feet of his Disciples and told them to live by His example. Jesus was betrayed by Judas and was arrested.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>
<h3>Good Friday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1 Peter 2:24</strong> <em>“He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds, you have been healed.”</em></p>
<p>Good Friday was observed this year on April 14, 2017. Good Friday commemorates the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Jesus willingly suffered for the sins of man which led to humanity’s salvation. After He was condemned to death by Pontius Pilate, He was scourged, beaten, mocked, and forced to carry his cross. Jesus was crucified and died at 3 in the afternoon. According to Matthew 27:51-54, “At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people. When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, ‘Surely he was the Son of God!’”</p>
<ol start=""6"">
<li>
<h3>Holy Saturday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Matthew 27: 62-64</strong> <em>The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.</em></p>
<p>Holy Saturday was celebrated this year on April 15, 2017. Holy Saturday observes the day that Jesus Christ was buried in His tomb after he had been crucified. It is a day of mourning and a somber reflection of a world without Christ’s resurrection. Israel’s Chief Priests had soldiers guard Jesus’ tomb until the third day because they suspected that one of His disciples may come, steal the body, and tell people that Jesus has been raised from the dead.</p>
<ol start=""7"">
<li>
<h3>Easter Sunday</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Matthew 28:18-20 </strong><em>Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</em></p>
<p>Easter Sunday or Resurrection Sunday was celebrated this year on April 16, 2017. Easter is a joyous celebration of how God rose Jesus Christ from the dead. According to Matthew 27:36-39, “While (the Disciples) were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</p>

"
 On Zeal and Diligence,https://news.auhs.edu/zeal-diligence/,,Morning Dew,"<p>This week’s Morning Dew was lead by Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS. They each took turns reading the following passages out loud and discussed what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><em>How can I be assured that my efforts will bring to me gain? By placing my faith in the Lord and being diligent with all that I claim to desire.</em></p>
<p>God knows all of your needs and desires. Rely on the Lord for guidance and peace of mind.</p>
<p>“My ultimate goal is the Lord’s will,” said Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, “No matter what I desire, I always say, ‘Lord, let your will be done.’ No matter what happens, I am reassured that it is all part of God’s plan.”</p>
<p>One must not depend on the promises of man but trust in the promises of Christ.</p>
<p>“If I depend on man then I cannot be assured that I am doing the right thing. But if I depend on God, then I know that no matter what I do, God is always watching over me,” said Ivy Javaluyas, the AUHS Director of Student Affairs, “Even if man does not give you what you deserve, God will reward you in the end.”</p>
<p>Not everyone will get what they want in life but there is a reason why. Never lose sight of the big picture.</p>
<p>“You don’t always get what you want because God has something better for you,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson talked about how he and his family went to Wondercon last weekend. Temujin, his youngest child, asked him for money so he could buy a few things from the vendors.</p>
<p>“I gave Temujin some money and he went and got packs of Pokemon cards. Then he bemoaned the fact that he spent all of his money on Pokemon cards. I said, ‘Temujin, you could have bought a collectible or you could have asked me to help pick something out for you,’” Pastor Johnson said, “I think God is always trying to figure out how to give his children the very best. God knows the things that make us, His children, happy. Parents want to give their children the very best and God is the greatest parent that we have.”</p>
<p>God wants us to be successful but He also wants us to be capable enough to help ourselves. The key to success is to remain diligent.</p>
<p>“I meet a lot of people who say that they want to be successful but they’re not applying themselves. They are not working towards their goals, they’re not putting in any effort, they just want to become successful overnight,” Pastor Johnson said, “But without diligence, without application, and without God, it is all meaningless.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mok Chong, the AUHS Director of General Education, referred to Psalm 127:1 “Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.”</p>
<p>“If you work towards a goal on your own, you may be successful but without God, your success will not have a very stable foundation. Your success will not last very long,” Dr. Chong said, “Rely on God. That’s the only way to do things. Give Him all the glory. No matter how impossible the task, if you give it up to the Lord, you will see the fruit of your labor.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson agreed with Dr. Chong. It is important to be diligent in your work but you must also seek God’s guidance in order to be truly successful.</p>
<p>“The funny part is that you can work hard on something and still fail, not because you lack diligence but because you left God out,” Pastor Johnson said, “Even if you only have very little to work with in this world, apply yourself to God and He will guide you and get you to where you need to be in life.”</p>
<p><strong>Diligence</strong></p>
<p><em>Be mindful of the effort by which you proceed each day </em></p>
<p><em>For what time and energy you apply to a thing</em></p>
<p><em>Will determine what comes your way </em></p>
<p>Do not waste your time and energy on trivial things. Find clarity and purpose through the word of God.</p>
<p>“We need to remind ourselves to apply our energy to the right things because sometimes you will lose your way,” said Stephanie Lien, the AUHS Librarian, “You might focus too much on something that doesn’t really matter. So it’s important to put that effort into something that’s actually important so we can be productive.”</p>
<p>Dr. Scherlin, the Provost of AUHS, shared with the room how her father was a Swedish immigrant and that she grew up on a farm in Vermont.</p>
<p>“My house was not about having fun, it was about hard work. The one thing that my parents taught me from a very early age is that if you do something, do it well. Do the best you possibly can or don’t bother trying at all,” Dr. Scherlin said.</p>
<p>While growing up, Scherlin resented her family because she had to support herself without her parent’s help.</p>
<p>“Everybody else’s parents helped them go to school but I had to pay for my own education. I had to do everything on my own,” said Dr. Scherlin, “But when I look back, I know now that my parents gave me a great gift because they taught me the value of hard work and independence. They taught me how to rely on myself and to rely on a higher power.”</p>
<p>Carlet Lacno, an AUHS accountant, shared how she had a side-job filing income taxes. She explained how she lost two clients last Saturday on account of due diligence. The clients told Lacno that they had 3 kids and wanted to file them as dependents. She asked them for the children’s birth certificates and immunization records but the clients claimed that they did not have the documents. They only provided Lacno with the children’s social security number.</p>
<p>“A social security number on its own did not mean anything to me. I asked them, ‘Why is the father not claiming them?’” Lacno said, “I kept asking questions and then they left. When I told my boss that I lost two clients because they could not present any documentation, my boss said, ‘I would rather have you lose those clients than you being penalized for not doing due diligence.’”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson reminded the room to not take anything for granted, not even the weather.</p>
<p>“I grew up on the east coast and if you’re not diligent, you will just freeze and die because of the cold. There’s a lot of sunshine on the west coast and people take it for granted. They think they have all the time in the world to do this and to do that,” Pastor Johnson said, “But life and death is in everything that we do. Life and death are in everything that we want. If we’re going to know success then we have to be the most diligent of all.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson urged all of the members in the room to be productive year-round.</p>
<p>“You cannot afford to waste time. You cannot afford to throw away an opportunity,” Pastor Johnson said, “You work hard and you play hard but you really have to work hard.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ryan then discussed what she thought of people who used the word, “Try.”</p>
<p>“‘Try’ does not mean anything. You either do it or you don’t. There is no real action to trying,” Dr. Ryan said, “I think that diligence is absolutely important in order for us to really accomplish anything.”</p>
<p><strong>Zeal</strong></p>
<p><em>I have seen how a man can labor. I have watched as a woman does try.</em></p>
<p><em>What I’ve noticed, more than anything. Are the ones who press hard, can fly.</em></p>
<p>God is always watching over us to see whether or not we are obedient to His will.</p>
<p>“The words ‘Press hard’ is actually a very interesting phrase because when you really want something, you have to put in a good effort for it. You need to have a good cause and a purpose,” Dr. Chong said, “God is always watching us. He knows what we want but God wants to see if we are listening to Him and if we are obedient to Him. He wants to see how we press on. This is what he wants us to do. He doesn’t need anything else from us. Obedience is better than sacrifice.”</p>
<p>As we grow older we often lose sight of our passion, zeal, and faith.</p>
<p>“When we were still young, we had a lot of dreams, passions, and zeal. We felt that anything was possible as long as we worked hard and remained diligent,” said Dr. Sisi Chen, the AUHS Director of Institutional Research and Assessment, “But once we stepped into the real world, we learn that life a lot more complicated than having diligence and hard work.”</p>
<p>There are many obstacles and external factors that prevent us from achieving our goals. We complain, get discouraged, and then we forget about all the dreams that we had when we were younger. We lose our diligence and we lose our passion.</p>
<p>“The most important thing to remember is that we do not work for ourselves, we work for God,” said Dr. Chen, “You may not be successful at first but if you remain diligent and if you remain true to God, you will find success.”</p>

 Spring 2017 Acts of Love,https://news.auhs.edu/spring-2017-acts-love/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp""></div>

<p><strong>Proverbs 21:26 </strong><em>“The righteous gives and does not hold back.”</em></p>
<p>More than 400 people gathered outside of American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) carrying carts, cardboard boxes, backpacks, and reusable shopping bags for the annual Acts of Love on Friday, March 31, 2017. Acts of Love is a community outreach event where AUHS gives free groceries to low-income families, senior citizens on fixed incomes, people with disabilities, and other individuals in need. The event was officially scheduled for 1-3 pm but there were several people who waited in line as early as 5 in the morning.</p>
<p>“We all need help. A lot of us (the attendees) have disabilities and live on fixed incomes. It’s hard to get by, especially at the end of the month,” said Jennifer, who attended Acts of Love for the first time.</p>
<p>Jennifer heard about the event from a friend’s caseworker. She was struggling to make ends meet and decided to participate.</p>
<p>“Living on a fixed income is difficult and sometimes money just doesn’t stretch far enough to cover all the groceries you need for the month,” Jennifer said, “(AUHS) is super awesome. The extra help that they give to the community is a blessing.”</p>
<p>As the crowd outside the gates of the university parking lot continued to grow, AUHS students, faculty and staff were hard at work preparing the carrots, apples, rice, chickens, cans of vegetables, and other food items for their guests. About 40 nursing students volunteered in this quarter’s Acts of Love.</p>
<div id=""attachment_6185"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6185"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6185"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_2816-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""><p id=""caption-attachment-6185"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Hundreds gather outside of American University of Health Sciences for the annual Acts of Love on Friday, March 31, 2017.</p></div>
<p>“This is my first time volunteering for Acts of Love. I’ve been here since 9 am bagging apples, setting up the chairs and tables, and pitching the tents,” said Inell Adams, an AUHS nursing student from Cohort 19, “We (the students) divided everything up to make sure that the people who came here today will get enough food by the time they leave.”</p>
<p>Adams was happy to be given the opportunity to make a difference in the community and believed that volunteering in events such as Acts of Love helped her better understand people from different cultures, backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses.</p>
<p>“I think that the university is doing a great job with helping the community. Nursing is a science and an art. You need to be able to think logically but at the same time, you need to be caring and giving,” Adams said, “Volunteering at these community events teaches us (AUHS students) how to better understand what they (the attendees) need and where they come from so that if they ever end up in a hospital or need treatment, we will know how to better communicate with them as nurses.”</p>

 AUHS Gifts Microwave to Hollenbeck Palms Nursing Home,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-gifts-microwave-hollenbeck-palms-nursing-home/,,University News,"<div id=""attachment_6158"" style=""width: 192px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6158"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6158"" src=""http://auhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Flores-Hollenbeck-Palms-Letter-182x300.jpg"" alt=""AUHS Professor Tracey Beltran-Flores with a letter from Hollenbeck Palms, thanking her and her Nursing Fundamentals class for donating a microwave in March 2017."" width=""182"" height=""300""><p id=""caption-attachment-6158"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS Professor Tracey Beltran-Flores with a letter from Hollenbeck Palms, thanking her and her Nursing Fundamentals class for donating a microwave in March 2017.</p></div>
<p>Students from American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) donated a brand new microwave to <a href=""https://www.hollenbeckpalms.com/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Hollenbeck Palms</a>, a retirement home in Boyle Heights, California in March 2017. Tracey Beltran-Flores, an AUHS Professor, and the students from her nursing fundamentals class wanted to show their appreciation to Hollenbeck for allowing them to work in their long-term care facility for their clinical hours.</p>
<p>“Our clinical sites are very valuable to us. Having good clinicals is extremely important to have in a nursing school because even though you learn a lot in the classroom, it’s easier to put faces to diseases and medications,” said Beltran-Flores, “In order for students to learn how to become nurses, they need to be in an actual hospital or clinical setting and work with actual nurses.”</p>
<p>AUHS teaches several clinical courses but for many students at AUHS, Hollenbeck is their first clinical site.</p>
<p>“In my nursing fundamentals class, we teach 109 nursing skills for the first five weeks of the term,” said Beltran-Flores, “In the last five weeks of the term we go to a nursing home, like Hollenbeck Palms, for the student’s first clinical experience.”</p>
<p>Hollenbeck Palms was a “wonderful place” for the students to learn how to care for patients who are elderly and living with chronic diseases, according to Beltran-Flores. Elderly and chronically ill patients are often the main focus of nurses in hospitals and clinics. Some of the responsibilities Beltran-Flores’s fundamentals class had at Hollenbeck Palms included transporting residents to the dining room, helping feed, bathe, and change the patients, and making the patient’s beds. AUHS students also passed out medications, took the patient’s vital signs and glucose measurements, assisted with feeding tubes, and started IV’s.</p>
<p>“We get close to the residents. (Hollenbeck Palms) is where our students get to do their first care plan so they get to really find out about one particular person,” said Beltran-Flores, “(AUHS students) practice what nurses do which is data gathering, looking at labs, x-rays, medications, going to assess the patient, and coming up with nursing priorities. Students get to learn the nursing process at this facility very well.”</p>
<p>The residents at Hollenbeck Palms enjoyed having AUHS students not only for their care and services but for providing fun activities as well.</p>
<p>“It can be kind of depressing to be in long term care. (AUHS students) like to cheer the residents up by playing rhythm band and bingo. We also have karaoke and talent shows,” said Beltran-Flores, “When our students are doing the talent shows and karaoke, I see residents smile that have never smiled before.”</p>
<p>AUHS students from clinical courses often give gifts to their clinical sites at the end of their term to show their gratitude, according to Beltran-Flores. In the past, her students had given Hollenbeck large baskets of fruit and even baskets of coffee mugs. But this year, her fundamentals class decided to do something extra special.</p>
<p>“Hollenbeck had a microwave that was really small and slow. It really needed to be replaced,” said Beltran-Flores, “The class decided that we would pitch in $5 each and we bought Hollenbeck a much larger microwave.”</p>
<p>One of Beltran-Flores’s students was a U.S. veteran and used his military discount to buy the microwave at Target. The student bought the microwave a week in advance because he was excited to give Hollenbeck the gift.</p>
<p>“The students were so proud to give that gift! We had to march the microwave all over the facility to show (the Hollenbeck staff) what we got for them,” said Beltran-Flores.</p>
<p>The Hollenbeck nurses and staff did not expect the AUHS students to give them a new microwave.</p>
<p>“What you usually get as a nurse is pizza and chocolates,” said Beltran-Flores, “But food goes very quick and not everybody gets a piece so I figured that if we gave them a gift like this, it would be something that everybody could enjoy for years.”</p>
<p>Hollenbeck Palms was created in 1890 by John and Elizabeth Hollenbeck and is the oldest nonprofit nursing home facility in California. William G. Heideman, the President and CEO of Hollenbeck Palms, is part of the same family that created Hollenbeck Palms, according to Beltran-Flores. Heidemen sent Beltran-Flores a letter, thanking her and her students for the microwave.</p>
<p>“On behalf of all of us at Hollenbeck Palms, we thank the students of AUHS for thinking of us. Their kind donation of a microwave oven is greatly appreciated and will come in handy for our SNF staff to use on a daily basis,” wrote Heideman, “Our mission of attending to residents with great compassion, honest dignity, and genuine love can only be achieved through the collective efforts of our staff, donors, supporters, and friends. Thank you for this extremely sweet gesture on the part of your students.”</p>

 Handling Stress,https://news.auhs.edu/handling-stress/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Amarri Sanders, AUHS Student Success Coordinator</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The subject for today’s Noonday Prayer is handling stress. We have a lot of things going on in AUHS. Everyone is always busy and working hard,” said Sanders, “I see how you all handle your stress differently and I think this would be a good topic for all of us to talk about.”</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Luke 21:14-19</strong> <em>But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. Everyone will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. Stand firm, and you will win life.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Although we must have the ability to take constructive criticism, it is imperative to stand firm in your beliefs. Never forget who you are.</p>
<p>“Recently I have had a lot of issues where people tell me to be a certain way in my life. Of course, we need be able to take constructive criticism so we can grow and improve ourselves. But sometimes it’s important to remember who you are and stand firm,” said Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliations.</p>
<p>In regards to handling stress, Jura advises her colleagues to remain calm under pressure.</p>
<p>“I think that being the calm in the middle of a storm is more effective than jumping to conclusions or resorting to anger,” Jura said, “It is good to take a moment and pause. You don’t have to answer right away. Just wait and you can think things through.”</p>
<p>It is important to leave the past behind and focus on the present so we can have a brighter future.</p>
<p>“The future is the future, the past is the past, but we really have to stay in the present and stay focused on what is happening today and how we feel right now,” Jura said, “If we stand firm on who we are, if we become the calm in the chaos, we will win life. We will be able to move forward and conquer whatever it is that we need to conquer in our own way because each of us is different.”</p>
<p>Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, was a licensed Family and Child Therapist and offered insight on what stress was from a psychological standpoint.</p>
<p>“Stress is really nothing more than a challenge that we are facing except there is a sense of personal threat. If we can look at any stressful situation and take the personal threat out of it, then it is just a challenge,” Dr. Ryan said, “People are capable of rising to the challenge but when there’s a sense of ‘Something is going to happen to me’ or ‘I’m going to die,’ then stress becomes triggered.”</p>
<p>The physiological response to fear and excitement is the same. The only difference is how we interpret it in our brains, according to Dr. Ryan.</p>
<p>“If we can take the stress and anything that we are feeling stressed about and reinterpret it and reframe it to what is actually happening then we can calm down and we can get through it,” Dr. Ryan said.</p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS, reminded everyone in the room to never forget who they really are.</p>
<p>“I think that the distractions and the noise come to make us move away from who we are. We are the sons and daughters of the Most High God,” Pastor Johnson said, “One of the things that I know for sure is that as a university, we have a cause and a purpose. We, as a university, do not act like the rest of the world and because of this, other people are going to despise everything that we stand for. They are going to despise your love and they are going to despise your good deeds.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson urged the room to remain diligent and steadfast in the face of adversity because God is with them.</p>
<p>“You are the sons and daughters of the Most High God regardless of who goes against against you,” Pastor Johnson said, “You will always win if you stand firm with God.”</p>
<p>Hai Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, shared with his co-workers how he struggled to come to terms with his identity.</p>
<p>“When I was in high school, I did not want people to know that I was Vietnamese. Obviously, that is something very hard to hide,” Luong said, “But until I really had a personal relationship with Jesus, I began to look at myself differently.”</p>
<p>Luong referred to 1 Samuel 16 where the Prophet Samuel came to anoint David with oil. Samuel was looking for a tall, strong and handsome man; all of the things that David was not. As a result, Samuel did not notice David.</p>
<p>“God told the Prophet Samuel that people look at one’s outward appearance but God looks at the heart. So our identity is really from within, not from without,” Luong said, “The holy spirit within us is really what identifies us and makes us who we are. When I learned this, I was no longer afraid of how people looked at me.”</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 118:5-6</strong> <em>When Hard-pressed, I cried to the LORD; he brought me into a spacious place. The LORD is with me; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?</em></p>
<p>The stress and pressures we face in life are unavoidable but God has the power to take away our burdens. Rely on the Lord and always ask Him for guidance.</p>
<p>“Patience is one of the hardest virtues to have because it is difficult to go through life’s many obstacles without losing it. However, if we can be patient and control our emotions, it can help us win in life,” said Aya Almukhtar, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, “Stress can lead to destructive actions. If you wear stress or frustration on your sleeves, then not only will distract you from your work but you will cause strife between you and your peers, coworkers and family members. Stress will lead you to chaos rather than success.”</p>
<p>Life can be difficult at times but we must be strong and always move forward. It is important to control your negative emotions and to not act like a child having a tantrum, according to Almukhtar. We must have self-control and overcome life’s obstacles with grace and dignity. Another thing that will help relieve stress is forgiveness.</p>
<p>“This verse makes me think of release. When I’m stressed out, I tend to bottle things up and then I want to explode. Sometimes we need to be reminded that if we let it go, you can have peace,” said Sanders, “When my aunt is talking to someone who is in pain or is struggling in life, she always tells them, ‘Just release it, let it go, move on, and we’ll go from there.’”</p>
<p><strong>Philippians 4:6-7</strong> <em>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</em></p>
<p>“I always involve God in everything I do. There is no situation where I do not involve God,” said Maria Maloles, the AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications, “I know I have been thrown into a lot of situations at home and at work but with God’s help, I feel like there’s someone always watching over me.”</p>
<p>When there are difficult situations and difficult people that give you a hard time, always do the best work you possibly can and pray to God for guidance.</p>
<p>“If I’m not doing the right thing, I still ask for God’s guidance and I ask somebody else to give me guidance if I’m doing it wrong,” said Maloles, “I’m always open to correction and criticism. I don’t take it so hard, and I have learned and grown so much because of it.”</p>
<p>Maloles thanked Pastor Johnson for mentoring her throughout her career in AUHS.</p>
<p>“I learned the hard way because Pastor was my mentor. I started this job in 2013 and I am a stronger person now than I was four years ago,” Maloles said.</p>
<p>Sanders shared with the room that one of the biggest reasons why she becomes stressed is because of her fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>“I always want to have a plan and I get anxious about things that are unknown. Uncertainty and not knowing what is going to happen next makes me feel uncomfortable,” Sanders said, “I tend to go to people who give me comfort and I realize that those people get their strength and comfort from God.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson talked about his relationship with his three children and compared it to humanity’s relationship with God.</p>
<p>“I look at my kids and when they want or need something, they don’t hesitate. They just go to the source. The problem we have when it comes to God is that we hesitate to ask Him for help because we want to handle it. We want to control the situation,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>When Pastor Johnson’s children need help, they expect their Father to give them an answer.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, because my children know that I love them, they can come to me easily and I can give them an answer,” Pastor Johnson said, “I think we just have to move away from this attitude of thinking that we are adults when it comes to God. We don’t need to be that way. We can go to God for advice, we can go to God for guidance, we can go to God for information.”</p>

 The First Day of Spring,https://news.auhs.edu/first-day-spring/,,Morning Dew,"<p><strong>Led by Dr. Mok Chong, AUHS Dean of General Education</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning of the meeting, Dr. Marilyn Uvero started to sing “You’ve Got a Friend” by James Taylor. Dr. Uvero’s colleagues joined her, singing, “Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. All you have to do is call.”</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero then went on to discuss the future of the university and how each of them played an essential role in helping their students become successful healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>“I look up to all of you to help support me and Dr. Caroll Ryan, especially Dr. Ryan, who is leading everyone at AUHS into a new season. It is the first day of spring and let us bring forth a new season, a new culture, and a new caring environment, not only for ourselves but for our students,” said Dr. Uvero, “Our students are here to look up to the future and the future of AUHS will be shepherded by all of us. It will not be deterred or broken by some of us. Let us do all that we can to support our students in every possible way so that they may achieve their dreams.”</p>
<p>They then read the following passages out loud and discussed what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Today is the first day of spring. It is turning into a new season- winter, spring, summer and fall. Life is a journey.</em></p>
<p>The coming of spring brings forth a brand new day and a brand new season because of the grace of God.</p>
<p>“Let us leave the past behind but bring the lessons we learned moving forward. Let us not repeat the mistakes we have made in the past,” said Ivy Javaluyas, the AUHS Director of Students Affairs, “Leave the bitterness and negativity behind and always keep moving forward.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ryan agreed with Javaluyas that it was a new beginning for them as individuals as well as a university.</p>
<p>“As we get older, we learn and we grow. The process of continuous improvement goes on forever,” said Dr. Ryan, “It is important to maintain a positive spirit and to maintain fresh eyes. We have to look at what we are doing now and how we can do it better. That is all part of us continuing to mature and fulfill what is expected of us.”</p>
<p>Dr. Chong happily announced that it was his 30th wedding anniversary and passed his wedding photos around the table for all of his co-workers to see. He and his wife were college students when they decided to get married.</p>
<p>“Spring was a good time to have a wedding because we had a break from school. I used to have a lot of hair now it’s all gone.” said Dr. Chong, “I think spring is definitely important because it is a new beginning for us both inside and out.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Life is a battle of spiritual warfare</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>As we are not fighting against the flesh and body</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Of all things on Earth, King Solomon asked God for wisdom</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>He said, “I like a child do not know how to go out or come in”</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>Yet I am always with you, Lord</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>You hold me by my right hand</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>You guide me with your counsel</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>And afterward you will take me to glory</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>My flesh and my heart may fail</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em>But God is the strength of my heart and my passion forever</em></p>
<p>Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliations, shared her own personal and spiritual battles with everyone in the room.</p>
<p>“I’ve been going through a spiritual warfare within myself since I’ve gotten divorced last April,” Jura said, “I have been searching for meaning in things that do not have meaning. I tend to forget myself and find happiness through other people, my children, my friends, and so on.”</p>
<p>Jura was married for seven years and when her relationship came to an end, her life was turned upside down.</p>
<p>“I was angry for a long time. When you’ve been married to someone for so long, you think that you know the person. Then you get that taken away from you,” Jura said, “I used to say, ‘Why God? Why do other women get to have a happy family and I don’t?’”</p>
<p>In the end, Jura realized where true love and happiness came from.</p>
<p>“It dawned on me that there are certain things in life that happen and you just have to accept it,” Jura said, “Happiness is about self-care, it’s about self-love, and it’s about self-preservation. If you don’t love yourself at all, you can’t love or give to others.”</p>
<p>Jura explained that it was the middle of Lent, a period of fasting and repentance for Christians in observance of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert.</p>
<p>“Lent is a time of self-discovery. The lessons that we need to learn is usually learned throughout lent,” Jura said, “Lent is not just about fasting or giving up chocolate. Lent is a time to give up anger, sadness, and jealousy.”</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons Jura learned through her personal experiences is that it was her calling to help other people.</p>
<p>“I think we are meant to take the lessons we have learned from our personal struggles and use it to help others,” Jura said, “Other people can learn from our mistakes.”</p>
<p>She remembered how two AUHS students came to visit her last week and were “upset about certain things.”</p>
<p>“I told (the students), ‘Listen, whatever you are going through, it will only make you a stronger person. You can use it to help yourself and to help others,’” Jura said, “I think with this first day of spring, we should reflect on what each of us went through during the dark times in our lives, to make it a lesson to yourself and a lesson to others.’”</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) welcomed incoming students in the Spring 2017 General Education Orientation in Room 206 on Friday, March 17, 2017. It is the goal of students in general education to become admitted into AUHS’ School of Nursing (SON) program however, they are missing prerequisite courses and other requirements. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, they will be ready to transition into the SON program. Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the AUHS Vice President of Operations and Development, was the first to give the incoming students a warm greeting.“Welcome to American University of Health Sciences,” said Dr. Uvero as she passed out her business cards to the attendees, “First and foremost, it is my responsibility to support you and help you succeed in this university. If you have any questions or need assistance with anything, my door is always open.”</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero then shared what programs the university provided as well as other opportunities that will be made available to the students in the near future.</p>
<p>“What we have to offer you now is a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy Technology, and a Master’s of Clinical Research,” said Dr. Uvero, “In the future, we will be offering a Master’s in Science of Nursing which will have different specializations including Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP), Nursing Leadership, Nursing Education, Master’s of Business Administration, Master’s of Health Care Administration, and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). We are also working on Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD).”</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero told the new students that she looked forward to seeing them learn, grow, and succeed as they began their careers as registered nurses. She encouraged the students to make the most out of their time at AUHS and to immerse themselves into the university’s culture of care and compassion, academic excellence, and love of God. The next person to present at the orientation was Dr. Mok Chong, the AUHS Dean of General Education.</p>
<p>“I think it is very important to know what is expected of you when you first come into this university. You are expected to go to all of your classes and study hard,” said Dr. Chong, “It is my job to help you become successful. You have my full support and I will always be there for you.”</p>

<p>Students must complete their prerequisite courses in order for them to transition to AUHS’ SON program so it is imperative that they do well in their general education classes, according to Dr. Chong. The general education program offered the nine prerequisite courses the students are required to take: chemistry with lab, anatomy with lab, physiology with lab, microbiology with lab, college-level algebra, statistics, English composition, intro to sociology, critical thinking, and general psychology. Dr. Chong also shared how AUHS’ general education program was different from most nursing schools.“We are probably the only health science university to emphasize art,” Dr. Chong said, “You will have to take two art classes. You will also get to learn about different cultures.”</p>
<p>General education also taught students about God and Christian values, according to Dr. Chong.</p>
<p>“Christianity is one of the fundamental pillars of AUHS and I always try to incorporate God into my lecture,” Dr. Mok said, “In some of my classes, I read Bible scriptures to the students before we start the lecture. Then I will give them a quiz on what we read but this is one of the few things the students don’t have to study for to do well on. All they have to do is listen.”</p>
<p>AUHS is a private, for-profit, minority owned, minority serving, Christian-based university whose mission is to educate and equip students with life careers and to produce quality health care professionals for the community, the nation, and the world. It is a university where appreciation of life and one’s spiritual reason for existence can be nurtured.&nbsp; AUHS offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (BSPS) and a Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR).

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) kicked off Spring 2017 with Nursing Boot Camp where AUHS nursing students will be evaluated on skills such as taking vital signs, foley catheter insertion and IV (intravenous) tubing from March 28-30, 2017. Students who will be entering or returning to a hospital or clinical setting are required to attend Boot Camp each quarter for assessment.</p>
<p>“The purpose of boot camp is to evaluate the competency level of students who are going to the next level,” said Dr. Betty Butler, an AUHS Associate Professor, “Boot Camp shows us (the AUHS School of Nursing) whether or not the students can critically think through some of these skills. Not only is it important to be able to perform these skills, but to also understand the concept or the critical element of performing these skills.”</p>
<p>The Boot Camp helps AUH nursing students prepare for what they are expected to know in a clinical setting such as preparing to start an IV, medical dosage calculations and performing head-to-toe assessments. Nursing Boot Camp is an all day event and involves students from all levels. There are nursing students from Fundamentals as well as students from Intermediate Medical-Surgical (Med-Surg) classes who are transitioning to Advanced Med-Surg. There are even senior level students that are moving up into their last Advanced Med-Surg class. Each student is tested according to his or her course level.</p>
<p>“The students who have taken Fundamentals, for example, need to demonstrate that they can do basic skills such as taking vital signs, blood pressure, and temperature,” said Dr. Butler, “The more advanced students get to do skills such as NG (nasogastric) tube insertion, primary IV, and secondary IV tubing. We have an intermediate group that gets to do a head-to-toe assessment and EKG (Electrocardiography) placements.”</p>
<p>AUHS nursing student Brittany Harwick from Cohort 17 attended her fourth Boot Camp on March 28, 2017. The 5 stations individuals were tested on in Harwick’s group was foley catheter, head-to-toe assessment, vital signs, medical administration, and IV start.</p>
<p>“Boot Camp helps refresh your skills. It is kind of nerve-wracking going in there, but otherwise, I think it is helpful,” said Harwick, “I feel pretty good about today’s assessment and I’m ready to go to clinical.”</p>
<p>Harwick studied extensively over spring break to prepare for Boot Camp.</p>
<p>“I studied the rubric and practiced on friends as much as I could, especially with my head-to-toe assessment,” Harwick said.</p>

<p>AUHS nursing student Laura Prickett from Cohort 17 was in the same Boot Camp group as Harwick. If there is an area a student did not pass, he or she will receive a one-on-one remediation from a clinical instructor in week 2 of the quarter, according to Prickett. This is Prickett’s fourth or fifth time at Boot Camp and she shared some of her insight about the quarterly event.</p>
<p>“I passed all my stations so I feel confident,” said Prickett, “I think overall Boot Camps helps to see where we’re at and who needs help as far as what experience they need. It helps us prepare for the clinical setting. Boot Camps makes up 5% of your lecture grade and is based on how many sections you passed.”</p>
<p>Prickett’s advice for students attending Boot Camp for the first time is to review ATI, know what the normal vital signs are and what to look for during assessments. The more you study, the better.</p>

 AUHS Throws Surprise Farewell Party for Assistant Dean of Nursing,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-throws-surprise-farewell-party-assistant-dean-nursing/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6127"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Dr.PadghamGoodbyeparty-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225"">American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) thanked Dr. Chery Padgham, the AUHS Assistant Dean of Nursing, for her 8 years of service by throwing her a surprise party in the 2nd Floor Conference Room on Thursday, March 23, 2017. AUHS faculty and staff hung a sign that read, “Thank you Dr. Cheryl Padgham” in the middle of the room and prepared a banquet filled with a variety of food, drinks, and desserts. Fellow AUHS co-workers clapped and cheered as Dr. Padgham entered the room.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to say that this is not goodbye, this is ‘See you later,’” Dr. Padgham said, “But wherever I go, I will always take AUHS with me because I have learned and grown so much in this university. Thank you all so much for always supporting me.”</p>
<p>Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, attended the farewell party to commend Dr. Padgham’s many contributions to the institution and asked her to always keep in touch.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dr. Padgham, for everything that you have done for the university. You have certainly made your mark. You are loved and you are cherished here,” said Dr. Ryan, “You know I have been working hard to make sure that this is not goodbye, to continue our relationship, and to continue to grow and develop as we go separate ways.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), the Founder of AUHS thanked Dr. Padgham for providing their students with quality education and for always being there for the university, especially in difficult times.</p>
<p>“You, (Dr. Padgham), have been there for you’ve seen us grow, you’ve seen us change. You have made a difference to the students that you had taught, you helped turn their lives around and they are so successful now,” said Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang shared with the room that 2015 “was not a good year” for her and 2016 was “even worse” but she is grateful for Dr. Padgham’s unyielding support. Dr. Padgham efforts helped AUHS obtain a successful CCNE accreditation, according to Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>“When everyone else was telling us ‘No’, you (Dr. Padgham) wanted this university to succeed,” said Dr. Dang, “Thank you for being there and believing in this institution.”</p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS, discussed how he had first met Dr. Padgham and how proud he was to have her as part of the AUHS family.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to give myself credit for anything but I actually did hire Dr. Padgham. I remember how you, (Dr. Padgham), sat in my office and talked about the things that you wanted to do and the things that you wanted to achieve,” Pastor Johnson said, “Most people don’t give others a chance. But I saw it in you and of course, I was right.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson shared how he encouraged Dr. Padgham to go back to school and earn her doctorate degree.</p>
<p>“I said that I would never ever go back to school after I got my Master’s Degree until Pastor convinced me to do it,” Dr. Padgham said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson thanked Dr. Padgham for helping AUHS grow and succeed. He thanked her for always being true and steadfast to the university and to God.</p>
<p>“It is really easy to be around when things are good but it is a true testament to your character when you stay when things are difficult. That’s when actually the greater blessings and the greater glory come in,” Pastor Johnson said, “I know that a lot of times it has been as difficult for you, Dr. Padgham, because I don’t see you that much, I’m not around you enough, and yet you remained steadfast, and you remained unmovable.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson told the room that the most important things in life are God and family. He said that they were brought together because of God.</p>
<p>“I still believe in creating a family of excellence in this university where people care about each other. We would not be here today had not God had chosen us, had not God watched over us, had not God brought us here,” Pastor Johnson said, “God put into Dr. Padgham’s heart that no matter what she went through in life, she remained steadfast. So thank you, Dr. Padgham. Thank you for being Cheryl, thank you for being the daughter of the Most High God, thank you for trusting God more than you trusted any event.”</p>

 A Christian Lifestyle,https://news.auhs.edu/a-christian-lifestyle/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Hai Luong, AUHS Admissions Coordinator</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The word of the Lord is powerful and life-giving. In 2 Timothy 3:16 it says that all scripture is inspired by God. God breathed life into what he wrote,” said Luong.</p>
<p>God used more than forty people who lived in different times, with different occupations and different backgrounds to write the Bible, according to Luong. Among those people were Matthew, Mark, Luke and John who were inspired by the Holy Spirit to write the four Gospels in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a&nbsp; personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 55: 8-9 </strong><em>“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”</em></p>
<p>God’s thoughts and actions are above human comprehension but we must have faith in His heavenly plan.</p>
<p>“We do not think the same way as God for a reason. He is telling us, ‘You are human and I am God, therefore My thoughts and My ways are going to be the correct path. Sometimes what you, as a human, may think is the right path is not the right path,’” said Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliations, “We should trust in the Lord and His ways and His thoughts.”</p>
<p>Although humans cannot be equal to God, we must always strive to become like Him.</p>
<p>“I think we all recognize that our thoughts are not superior to the thoughts of God,” said Dr. David Hawkins, the AUHS Dean of School of Pharmacy, “But we could ask for God’s thoughts to become our thoughts, for His desires to be our desires, for His will to be our will then we will be able to live a great lifestyle.”</p>
<p>Humans are imperfect and are likely to succumb to temptation but God always brings us a new day and a second chance to change. God wants us to love one another as He loves us.</p>
<p>“Even though we know that we can never be equal and we can never come close to God’s thoughts and desires, I think we should still try, especially in our interactions with each other,” said Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, “We must always try to bring love, concern, and care into how we relate to one another. God lives in all of us so why would we treat each other in a way that is less than godly?”</p>

<p>Luong shared a story of how he and his wife went to see a presentation from Nicholas James Vujicic. Vujicic is a Christian Evangelist and motivational speaker from Australia who was born without arms and legs. He had traveled all over the world, sharing his story and the word of God to millions of people.</p>
<p>“(Vujicic) was born without arms and legs. He said, ‘Why God? Why did you create me without arms and legs?’” Luong said, “He used to question God, he used to ask God for a miracle, he used to ask God for arms and legs.”</p>
<p>When Vujicic went to school, children teased and bullied him for his birth defect. He was severely depressed for the first 15 years of his life.</p>
<p>“When (Vujicic) was 10 years old, he wanted to commit suicide. He filled his bathtub with water and tried to drown himself,” Luong said, “But then he had second thoughts. He said, ‘Well, my parents had already suffered enough. If I died this way it would just add more sorrow to them.’”</p>
<p>Vujicic then turned to the Bible for answers. He read about a man in John Chapter 9, who had been born blind. People asked Jesus, “Why was this man born blind?” Jesus said, “This man was born blind because the work of God will be revealed in his life and you will see the glory of God.” Jesus healed the blind man and restored his sight.</p>
<p>“When (Vujicic) read that story he said, ‘Now I know God’s thoughts are higher than my thoughts. God has a plan for my life.’ And from then on, his life was changed forever,” Luong said, “He is one of the most famous people in the world. He had traveled over a hundred countries, he has spoken to presidents and world leaders. Millions of people came to know Jesus through his life.”</p>
<p>There was one story Vujicic shared that touched Luong the most. Several years ago in California, Vujicic spoke to a crowd of about 3 thousand people. During his speech, a man in the audience lifted a little boy up in the air. The little boy was about 19 months old and had no arms or legs like Vujicic.</p>
<p>“The boy only had a tiny leg with two toes. Nick asked the parents to bring up the boy. He could not give the boy a high-five but gave him a low two,” Luong said.</p>
<p>The little boy’s parents told Vujicic that because of him, they understood why their son was born this way that God had a plan for him.</p>
<p>“God used (Vujicic)&nbsp; to become a miracle for the little boy,” said Luong, “(Vujicic) said, ‘Even though you don’t get a miracle, you can be a miracle to other people. I was born without arms or legs but God used me to be his hands and feet for other people.’”</p>
<p><strong>James 1:22</strong> <em>But be you doers of the word, and not hearer only, deceiving your own selves.</em></p>
<p>Most of us can hear the voice of God but tend to ignore it.</p>
<p>“Most of the time we know God’s will but we do not act in a way that is consistent with His word.We hear His will but we do not act upon it. We have not internalized what God expects us to do,” said Dr. Sisi Chen, the AUHS Director of Institutional Research and Assessment, “That internalization takes time to learn that’s why we’re in Noonday Prayer.”</p>
<p>Dr. Chen told the room that by attending Noonday Prayer, they learned from each other experiences and each other’s knowledge of God.</p>
<p>“If we keep learning more about God, it will help us internalize God’s will which will help guide our actions,” said Dr. Chen.</p>
<p>Actions speak louder than words. In order to receive God’s blessing, we must bless one another with kindness.</p>
<p>“We have opportunities every day to be good, to be kind, to be loving, and to be helpful,” said Dr. Ryan, “We’ve got plenty of time and room to practice patience, love, and kindness with one another.”</p>
<p><strong>James 4:17</strong> <em>Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.</em></p>
<p>It is not the pain and suffering we experience in life that defines us, but what we do with it in the end. We can choose to dwell in bitterness and self-pity or we can choose to inspire and ease the pain of others who suffered just like you.</p>
<p>Chantal Jura, the Director of Career Services and Affiliations shared how she often talks to and tries to help homeless individuals.</p>
<p>“The homeless people that I talk to always have a story to tell. There were some who ended up in juvenile hall, then they went to prison, and the cycle continued. So I would ask them, ‘If there is anything in the world that you could do, what would you do?’” Jura said.</p>
<p>Jura recalled how a homeless man told her that he wanted to play soccer but said that it was too late for him. Jura suggested that he could teach youth and become a coach for a soccer team.</p>
<p>“I told him, ‘You grew up on the streets, you know those street kids. You could help them play soccer. You could make sure they won’t make the same mistakes that you did because they will look up to you,” said Jura, “I tell everyone who’s been through rough times, ‘It’s not too late because in teaching others, we are able to heal ourselves.’”</p>
<p>Acts of love can go a long way.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the smallest act of kindness can make a whole difference in someone else’s life,” said Luong, “God can use anyone of us to change lives so we always have an opportunity to do good. When God gives us the opportunity, we should take it.”</p>

 Godly Decisions,https://news.auhs.edu/godly-decisions/,,Morning Dew,"<p><strong>Led by Dr. Mok Chong, AUHS Dean of General Education</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several applicants from AUHS’ School of Nursing program also attended the Morning Dew meeting before their 10 am interview.</p>
<p>“We have Morning Dew every Monday from 9-10 am. Usually, the (Co-founder of AUHS) Pastor Gregory Johnson leads this meeting but every once in awhile, he asks me to do it for him,” Dr. Chong explained to the applicants, “Today’s Morning Dew is about life, wisdom and decision making. As you are applying to our BSN program, you want to know that you are making a good decision. As a Christian university, we also want you to make Godly decisions.”</p>
<p>Together they read the following passages and discussed what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:3</strong><em> It is God’s will, that you should be holy and be sanctified in your living.<br>
</em><br>
God has spoken to us and His will has been written in the Bible. His words are sacred and we must always use it as our moral compass.</p>
<p>“God has already spoken His words. We need to read (the Bible) to be reminded of how we have to strive to become like God. We have to be holy and to always be grateful for the blessings in our lives,” said Cynthia Chamber, and AUHS Financial Aid Administrator.</p>
<p>God wants us, His children, to live a pure and holy life.</p>
<p>“God asks us to be purified, to be made holy and to live life according to Godly teachings. We always need to be pure, honest, and always operate from goodness rather than negative energy,” said Aya Almukhtar, and AUHS Admissions Coordinator, “We are responsible for not only ourselves but for how other people feel as well. Don’t cause harm or among ourselves. In order for us to live with one another in peace and harmony, we should invest in others by doing good and help each other when we can. Only then can we be blessed.”</p>
<p>Being a pure and Godly person does not mean you will not make mistakes but we must strive to live by God’s will.</p>
<p>“Holiness does not mean you have to be perfect. Holiness is not unattainable,” said Dr. Chong, “Holiness means that you want to be as close to being good as God is. Do your best to live by His word.”</p>
<p>Your intentions also determine your goodness and faithfulness towards God.</p>
<p>“To be truly close to the Lord, one requires a level of sincerity that’s not pretentious and not a fake,” said AUHS President Dr. Caroll Ryan, “Our thoughts and our actions have to be aligned in everything we do today and in the future.”</p>
<p>Dr. Chong reminded the room that the blessing the university receives from God depends on their faith, words, and actions.</p>
<p>“If you want God to flow in your life, if you want God to flow this university, we have to align with God. There is no other way,” said Dr. Chong.</p>
<p><em>Knowing what God wants you to be is more precious than what you’d like to do</em></p>
<p><em>I urge you to live in order to please almighty God</em></p>
<p><em>Our God is more concerned with who we are than what we do</em></p>
<p><em>Jesus never asked what job we had but questioned out characters</em></p>
<p><em>Whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of Jesus Christ</em></p>
<p><em>Holiness is in line with the right relationship with God</em></p>
<p><em>Thus, it is important to make right and godly decisions</em></p>
<p>Humans are imperfect and will make mistakes in life. Sometimes humans make excuses and believe their bad decisions are necessary. Sometimes humans are unaware of how their actions hurt other people.</p>
<p>“As humans, we make bad decisions in our life. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally we do wrong but that’s why it’s important to ask God for guidance,” said Ivy C. Javaluyas, the AUHS Director of Student Affairs, “We always need the grace and guidance from God so whatever decisions we make is according to God’s will.”</p>
<p>Javaluyas encouraged the room to try to be the best version of themselves and to be as kind as possible.</p>
<p>“Prayers are always your best weapon,” Javaluyas said.</p>
<p>Amarri Sanders, an AUHS Student Success Coordinator, believed that no matter what you want, God does what is best for you.</p>
<p>“When you want to do something, when you want to be like something, and you feel like you’re pushing against the grain. Maybe in your teenage years, you rebelled, and you did those things you didn’t know was right,” said Sander, “When you get older, you learn from your mistakes and you and become the person you were always supposed to be. We do things that will steer us off God’s path but as long as we were meant to be on the right path, we will go back to Him.”</p>
<p>Almukhtar shared the story of her life to the room. She came from a wealthy family in Iraq. Her father was a Vice Minister, she had drivers and servants, and she had the best life. When war broke out, her way of life was stripped from her. Her home, money, and possessions were gone.</p>
<p>“I was angry at God. I said, ‘Why? Why did you turn me into an immigrant? Why did you make me wander the world, nobody knowing who we are?’” c “But then I came to America, I started studying at one of the best schools because any school is America is better than any school in Iraq anyways. The education, the things I learned, the people I met, everything that happened to me in America is much better from what I expected in Iraq.”</p>
<p>She thought the money and comfort that she had in Iraq was good for her but she says she is much happier today working for her own food, clothes, and rent.</p>
<p>“In America, everyone is equal. This is much better than no freedom and no human rights, in Iraq. It took war, it took pain and hardship to direct me to the path God wanted for me,” Almukhtar said, “If not for Him, I would probably be in Iraq right now kidnapped by Isis, struggling in an unhappy marriage, or God know what. Even when there is crisis or misfortune, it is all part of God’s plan. Be patient.”</p>
<p><em>Illusion of perfection makes us defer our journey</em></p>
<p><em>We become so careful and fearful to make decisions that are perfect</em></p>
<p><em>In the Bible, even Paul was not sure every step he took</em></p>
<p><em>Paul said, “Perhaps I will stay with you a while so you can help me in my journey”</em></p>
<p><em>I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit</em></p>
<p><em>I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits</em></p>
<p><em>But I will stay on because a great door for effective work has opened to me</em></p>
<p><em>And there are many who oppose me</em></p>
<p><em>May our God guide us step-by-step and day-by-day</em></p>
<p><em>In what we do and how our faith goes</em></p>
<p><em>Walk with the wise and become wiser</em></p>
<p><em>Associate with the fools, you shall get into trouble</em></p>
<p><em>At the end, our God Gives us the wisdom to decide</em></p>
<p>“We get confused because we always want what we want. But to live in the will of God, it doesn’t mean comfort or money. To live in the will of God is finding the fullness of life,” said Dr. Chong, “Sometimes we have to go through trials and tribulations but the will of God does not mean everything is going to be smooth. There are times we will go through the storm but in the end we see what God had done for us.”</p>
<p>Hai Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, walked to the front of the room to share his thoughts. He said he was grateful to be in Morning Dew because in all of his year working, he had never served a place that started the week praising God. Morning Dew prepares him for the rest of the week. Luong then discussed how God wanted each of them to grow and build character.</p>
<p>“God is very interested in developing character because character is what lives with us forever. Whatever we do here on Earth, God wants us to work together,” Luong said.</p>
<p>Luong referred to Romans 8:28- All things work together for those who love God, for those called according to God’s purpose.</p>
<p>“God has a purpose, a plan for each one of us and he will allow good and bad things in our lives to make us a better person,” said Luong.</p>
<p>Luong recalled how there was a point in his life where had a big house and many cars but he lost everything. He lived on a hispanic family’s sofa for 3 months.</p>
<p>“For the first time, I got to know hispanic people. I discovered how they risked their life to come to America so it made me feel very grateful,” Luong said. “I remember telling my relatives at the time, that I lived with a hispanic family. You know how in every culture, if they hear something they’re not used to they become very afraid. The said, ‘Really? Those are gangster people, you live with them?’ I said, ‘No, these people are very nice. They welcomed me into their home like a family. I got to know them, I got to share their food, it changed my life. It changed my perspective in life and I did not look at people the same way as I used to.’ I love everybody sincerely, with the love of God. God uses all of that to make us better.”</p>
<p>Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the AUHS Vice President of Operations and Development, shared a list of questions and encouraged the room to reflect on them.</p>
<p>“How do we act as God wants us to? How concerned are you when you do not do what you want to do? How will you act and speak, so you are representative of Jesus Christ?,” Dr. Uvero said, “How are you going to share your thoughts and how are you going to form your character so that you are in the image of Jesus Christ? Just how important is it for you to be righteous and godly? Are you going to claim godly decisions or are you going to claim human decisions?”</p>

 The Gift of Giving,https://news.auhs.edu/gift-of-giving/,,Morning Dew,"<p><strong>Led by Pastor Gregory Johnson, Co-founder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I am certain if I consider what was done that I’ll realize what was given by the Son. It compels me to practice as I walk in “The Way,” to give as He gives us each day.</em></p>
<p>“God is with us always and we must walk in the path God has prepared for us,” said Dr. Mok Chong, AUHS professor, “This makes me think about what God has done for the world. He is the way, the truth, and the life.”</p>
<p>No matter where we go in life, God is with us. Although we are not perfect, we must walk in the path of His love and His word.</p>
<p>“When you think about what Jesus did for us in terms of giving His life, how much certain can we be of God’s love for us?” said Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS.</p>
<p>Although God’s love is unconditional and everlasting, there are times in life where we feel alone and unloved. Hai Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, grew up in Vietnam with a family of thirteen children. His parents were often away from home so they could work and put food on the table. Luong always felt lonely as a child and always wondered if his parents really loved him. Although he was raised in a Christian family, he struggled to see God’s love for him. But when he took the time to read the word of God, his eyes were forever opened.</p>
<p>“When I came to America and really took the time to read the word of God, I experienced the love of Jesus,” Luong said, “God created us with an emptiness, a vacuum inside our heart that only God can fill. When I realized how much Jesus had done for us, how He came to this Earth to die on the cross for us, how He loved us unconditionally, I then realized what was given by the Son. Jesus gave us all the love in the world and when I received His love, the emptiness in my heart was filled.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson told the room to never take their life for granted because it is a gift from God.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we take for granted the life that we have been living. Every day in America, babies are killed, babies are sent away, and here we sit around and take for granted the fact that we’re alive,” said Pastor Johnson, “We take the fact that Christ died for us for granted. We take our food, our clothes and our health for granted. You need to consider all the people you see every Sunday to determine whether or not the life that you have is blessed.”</p>
<p><strong>Giving- </strong><em>Giving is not parting with what you hold, it’s receiving the goodness your generosity unfolds. When you practice giving to others, what you may need, God ensures your prayers succeed.</em></p>
<p>When you give to others, it is not a loss. You always gain more than what you give.</p>
<p>“I went through a phase in life where I was oblivious and selfish. I was young and didn’t know better,” said Aya Almukhtar, AUHS Admissions Coordinator, “Then I started to mature in Christ and I became more spiritual. I began to understand what it means to be responsible for our brothers and sisters who are in need.”</p>
<p>We must do what is pleasing to God instead of pleasing ourselves with materialistic or worldly things.</p>
<p>“When you practice the giving act, you won’t get instant gratification or materialistic rewards, but you will get many blessings in return. God will put people in your path so you can give to them,” said Almukhtar, “Sometimes giving does not necessarily mean you need to give others money. The simplest act of giving could be with a kind word, a smile, and an honest deed.”</p>
<p>A lot of times when we give something, it is not out of comfort. The greatest things that you can give are the things that will make your own life unpleasant or uncomfortable. Pastor Johnson recalled how he studied for his respiratory therapy degree in Baltimore, Maryland, many years ago.</p>
<p>“It was a class of privileged kids. I was not privileged but I was there and I was the brightest one in the class. The hospital administrators were enamored with me,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>There was a black female student in the class who was not performing well, academically and the administrators planned to expel her. Pastor Johnson spoke with the director of the program and asked him why they decided to terminate the black female student and not the privileged student, (the daughter of a doctor), who was also performing in class just as poorly.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘I’ll get out of the program if you let her stay.’ The director gets up from his desk and started slamming everything around his office. He was so upset because I was his protégé,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson understood that he was an “inner-city kid,” his mother and grandmother cleaned houses for a living and that the quality of his own life was at stake.</p>
<p>“But I understood in that moment that this was going to be life and death for her. I wanted her to stay in the program and graduate. I knew that God will give me another opportunity,” Pastor Johnson said, “Sure enough, she graduated from the program. She was successful.”</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) attended the 26th Annual Interfaith Intercultural Breakfast, hosted by <a href=""http://www.cacej.org/"">The California Conference for Equality and Justice</a> (CCEJ) in the Long Beach Convention Center on Sunday, March 2, 2017. Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the AUHS Vice President of Operations and Development, Chantal Jura, the Director of Affiliations and Development, Sara Pol-Lim, the AUHS Board of Trustees Chair, and Hai Luong, an AUHS Admissions Coordinator, attended the breakfast conference to better understand the mission and organizational structure of the CCEJ and to reach out to other institutions who share the same values as AUHS.</p>
<p>“The CCEJ is a human relations organization dedicated to social equality. They confront biases and racism through education, conflict resolution, and advocacy,” said Dr. Uvero, “It was my first Interfaith Intercultural Breakfast and it was a very exploratory meeting. CCEJ gave me insight on how to positively respond to racism through education.”</p>
<p>The Interfaith Intercultural Breakfast was brought to the university’s attention by Lim, according to Dr. Uvero. AUHS then sponsored a table at the event. There were thousands of attendees including representatives from Kaiser Permanente, the Cambodian Association of America and even the Mayor of Long Beach, Robert Garcia, according to Dr. Uvero.</p>
<p>“The organizations that attended this conference came to celebrate what the CCEJ had accomplished,” said Dr. Uvero.</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero commended CCEJ for responding to the issues of racism and social inequity by establishing programs such as the <a href=""http://www.cacej.org/cause/building-bridges/"">Building Bridge Camp</a>, Conscious Classrooms, the <a href=""http://www.cacej.org/cause/restorative-justice/"">Restorative Justice Juvenile Diversion Program</a>, and more.</p>
<p>“Through the establishments of these programs, CCEJ proved that negative concepts such as racism can be resolved through education,” Dr. Uvero said.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6081"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CCEJ.group_.pic2_-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"">breakfastThe most memorable presentation Dr. Uvero had during the event was from poet and activist, Luis J. Rodriguez. Rodrigues was a keynote speaker at the breakfast conference and his speech focused on equality.</p>
<p>“He shared political comments, mostly about biases and inequality but the one thing that really struck me was when he said that the United States is not for a selected people, the United states is for all people,” said Dr. Uvero, “He also said that the Earth is for all people and that we need to stand firm because when we step on the Earth, we claim that is for everyone. I thought that was very insightful.”</p>
<p>After the presentations, Dr. Uvero had an opportunity to meet Rex Richardson, the Vice-Mayor of Long Beach.</p>
<p>“We introduced ourselves to Vice-Mayor Richardson and talked about the mission of AUHS,” Dr. Uverso said, “Vice-Mayor Richardson said he appreciated how we (AUHS) joined them at the breakfast conference. I said that we looked forward to having him get to know (the university) better and we will continue to support to the CCEJ.”</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero also had the opportunity to meet with long-time humanitarian Gene Lentzner who had offered 40 years of service on the CCEJ board. Lentzner’s 95th birthday was the same day as the breakfast conference.</p>
<p>“He inspired me on how it really means to dedicate yourself and your services to an organization that you believe in,” Dr. Uvero said.</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero had been an educator for 35 years and many of her core values aligned with the CCEJ’s mission.</p>
<p>“I look at my students all equal. I do not see color and I do not see ethnicity. But what I do see is whether or not they are attending class and whether or not the have the tenacity to become what they choose to be in life,” Dr. Uvero said, “I am there to help them achieve their dreams because one’s character and success has no color.”</p>
<p>AUHS is a private, for-profit, minority owned, minority serving, Christian-based university whose mission is to educate and equip students with life careers and to produce quality health care professionals for the community, the nation, and the world.

 AUHS Winter 2017 Retrospective,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-winter-2017-retrospective/,,University News,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6077"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Dr.Uvero-Gen.Ed_-300x205.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""205"">American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) thanks&nbsp;to all of its students, faculty, and staff for a blessed and exciting first term of the school year! As the Winter 2017 Quarter comes to an end, AUHS faculty and staff reflects on some of their favorite moments in the quarter and offers their best wishes to their students.</p>
<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p>Dr. Marilyn Uvero, the AUHS Vice President of Operations and Development, asks her students to continue to excel in their academics and to always remember that there are no challenges they cannot overcome.</p>
<p>“I hope all AUHS students continue to work towards achieving their dreams and that challenges should be considered as opportunities for them to learn and become stronger,” Dr. Uvero said, “They need to assure themselves that they can do better.”</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero wants her students to always move forward, learn from their mistakes and to constantly find ways to improve themselves academically, personally, spiritually, and professionally.</p>
<p>“If students feel that they did not perform as well as they could have in the winter session, then they have the spring quarter to prove to themselves that they could be better,” Dr. Uvero said.</p>
<p>Dr. Uvero recalled how towards the end of the Winter 2017 session, one of her students emailed her explaining why she had been absent from class. The student said that she was depressed because she did not pass the TEAS (Test of Essential Academic Skills) exam, she should not handle coming to class that day and needed to walk away.</p>
<p>“I responded back to her and thanked her for reaching out to me. But I said that we as nurses cannot walk away from challenges because we need to be strong for our patients,” Dr. Uvero said, “I encouraged her to be strong, learn how to overcome her challenges and that it’s not the end. She should always move forward.”</p>
<p>Although the winter session had just ended, Dr. Uvero is looking forward to the Spring 2017 Quarter. AUHS is in the stage of growth and transformation. There will be a change in leadership by spring, according to Dr. Uvero</p>
<p>“The spring brings to us Dr. Caroll Ryan who is AUHS’ new president. I can see a great transition between AUHS Founder, Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.) and Dr. Ryan and I could see a very great transition between myself and AUHS Co-founder, Pastor Gregory Johnson,” said Dr. Uvero, “Dr. Ryan and I hope to bring the University to where it’s supposed to be and to better serve our students. We want to make sure that AUHS will be the greatest university that we have always aspired to be and that there’s no limit to achieving success.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mok Chong, the AUHS Dean of General Education had many memorable moments teaching his Philosophy 304 Ethics class this quarter.</p>
<p>“I had a lot of fun in my ethics class. We talked about the bible and we talked about contemporary issues including the 2016 presidential election. I liked teaching that class very much,” said Dr. Chong.</p>
<p>Dr. Chong congratulated graduating students on their success and wished them luck“For the students who are graduating this year,&nbsp; I wish you all the best for whatever undertaking you are doing. I also know that you are going to be great nurses,” Dr. Chong said.</p>
<p>He also had a few words of advice for new and returning AUHS students.</p>
<p>“For those new students coming in, know that the university is here to help you. Your professors and your dean are here to support you. We have an open door policy so if you need any help, please come and knock on our door,” said Dr. Chong, “Your job as a student is to study, study and study. Always do your best and focus on what you need to do to be successful.”</p>
<p>Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliation, shared some of the highlights of Winter 2017.</p>
<p>“My favorite moment of Winter 2017 was the first employer panel that we had which was a great success and I was happy to see that move forward,” said Jura.</p>
<p>The university’s first bi-annual <a href=""/2017/03/16/auhs-students-receives-valuable-career-advice-employer-panel/"">Employer Panel</a> took place on March 13, 2017. AUHS nursing students had the opportunity to speak with representatives from The Salvation Army, DaVita, and Signal Hill Mayor Lori Woods and obtain valuable career advice. The panel was hosted by Jura.</p>
<p>Jura had some words of encouragement for the students graduating this year.</p>
<p>“My last note for graduating students of 2017 is to not give up, keep moving forward and always keep your head up. It doesn’t matter how many times we fall down, it’s how many times we get up that counts.”</p>

" Transitions, Transformations, and Change",https://news.auhs.edu/transitions-transformations-change/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong><em>Led by Cynthia Chambers, AUHS Financial Aid Administrator</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“We are not human beings on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a human journey.”- Stephen Covey.</em></p>
<p>“Change is a part of each day’s fabric- it is palpable, real and necessary. In order to grow in spirit we must each transition,” said Chambers, “We are promised that if we repent, we will be saved and have eternal salvation. Our spiritual journey is a quest where we set out to discover who we are and what God’s plan for us might be. We learn lessons along the way.”</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Holy Bible. Each attendee took a turn to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to him or her on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:2</strong> <em>And be not conformed to this word: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</em></p>
<p>Humans are imperfect and are bound to make mistakes. But life is a spiritual journey and we must learn from our mistakes in order to become closer to God.</p>
<p>“Sometimes if you are the one that is making a mistake, you might not know that what you are doing is wrong,” said Ivy Javaluyas, the AUHS Director of Student Affairs, “We need guidance from God and we need to pray that our minds and hearts will be transformed by the will of God.”</p>
<p>Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Affiliations and Development, took her mother and two daughter to a Catholic church for Ash Wednesday. She was touched by the priest’s sermon that day about Lent. (Lent is a period of fasting and abstinence between Ash Wednesday and Easter. It is an observance of how Christ fasted for 40 days in the wilderness and was tempted by the devil).</p>
<p>“Oftentimes we think of fasting as giving up food, almost like a New Year’s resolution,” said Jura, “But the priest said, ‘Lent is a time of fasting from anger and to accept love. It is a time of fasting from sadness and to accept gratitude. It s a time of fasting from hate and to accept peace. So by the time that Easter comes, you are a better person.’”</p>
<p>Lent is a time of self-reflection and Jura realized that although she will make mistakes, it is not the end because God continues to shape and mold her every day. Life is a spiritual journey. Our constant change and transformation as Christians mirrors how AUHS is also evolving. It is important to embrace positive change.</p>
<p>“Do not stay where you are at, the world is in constant evolution and so are we. When God first made us, we were primitive, simple beings but even today, with all our advancements in medicine and technology, we are still in the process of being evolution,” said Aya Almukhtar, and AUHS Admissions Coordinator, “Evolve, become bigger, learn from your past mistakes, and become a better person, even in the university here.”</p>
<p>Almukhtar shared with the room how she is constantly trying to better serve and communicate with the university’s students. She and her department were becoming more proactive in reaching out to different schools and communities and share the opportunities AUHS had to offer.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson, Co-founder of AUHS, said that our personal and spiritual evolution is to become like Christ.</p>
<p>“When Christ came down and the word became flesh, his time on Earth was temporary. He was here for a season to make a difference and then He went back to God. All of us are on that same journey,” said Pastor Johnson, “We do not belong here on Earth. This is not our world. This is a place where we’re visiting to make better, just like Christ came to make things better, before we return home to our Father.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson talked about how he was fascinated by the fact that children are innocent and have a God-like vision. Children are so innocent because they have just recently been with God. Children can see and believe in things that adults are unable to.</p>
<p>“Children were so close to God at a short period of time in coming into this Earth. For adults, because of the time we have spent here, there is all this pollution, noise and distractions that limits us and makes us forget who we are,” said Pastor Johnson, “We are sons and daughter of the most High God, we are the breath of God, God is in us.”</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 24:10</strong> <em>If you do nothing in a difficult time, your strength is limited.</em></p>
<p>Brian Cuffey, an AUHS Maintenance man, said that this bible verse reminded him of a time where he had to cut vines that had enveloped a wall.</p>
<p>“You know how vines sometimes take over and then it gets tangled up and the branches just seem to grow and get thicker and thicker? It gets kind of hard to cut,” Cuffey said, “I was at that point where I just did not want to do it because it was painful. But Pastor kept telling me, ‘Brian, just do it. The quicker you get it done, the better off it will be.’ Well, that is the same thing with God. When you do not have any strength, and you just do not feel like doing it, then He will give you the strength to get you through what you need to get through.”</p>
<p>Dr. Caroll Ryan, the President of AUHS, believed that true strength comes from unity.</p>
<p>“Our strength as a university comes from working together and drawing from our prayers to asking God to help us,” said Ryan, “Strength does not come opposing one another, fighting with one another and pointing fingers at one another. I am all about letting down walls and encouraging and supporting the relationships so we can become bigger than what we are.”</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:9</strong> <em>The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.</em></p>
<p>God’s plan for us has a time and season for everything in life.</p>
<p>“What we consider slow is actually not slow because God is giving you time to change your mind about the decisions you have made. You think God is not helping you quick enough but He knows what you are doing, He knows your beginning and He knows your end. God is just giving you the opportunity to turn around and change,” said Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), the Founder of AUHS, “God does not want any of us to perish.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang recalled how she and her husband, Pastor Johnson, first began AUHS. They wanted to buy a building on Atlantic street and turn it into a university. Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson prayed and hoped that God would bless them with this building.</p>
<p>“Everyone guaranteed that we would get this building, they told us nobody wanted it and that we were going to get it at the price that we wanted. We prayed, we fasted, and guess what? It did not happen. Someone else wanted that building,” said Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson were disappointed. They said, “Why God? We did everything we were supposed to do? Why did this happen to us?”</p>
<p>However, Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson soon realized that this setback was a blessing in disguise. The building they intended to purchase would have never become a school because it had no parking lot.</p>
<p>“The building we wanted to buy rented their parking lot. If we had gotten this building, then AUHS would not be where it is today,” said Dr. Dang, “At the time, we considered it as a let down but God was just trying to say, ‘Hey, I’m being patient towards you. You are an idiot. Don’t you know that building doesn’t have a parking lot?’”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson interrupted Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. I wanted that building. I prayed on that building. I walked around that building with my bare feet for 6 days,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang replied, “I’m pretty sure God looked down on you from the sky and said, ‘Dude, put your shoes back on. Go back home.’”</p>
<p>Pastor turned and explained to the room, “I walked around that building seven times on the seventh day, on my bare feet. I prayed in the middle of the day, while people were driving down the street, with my hands up to heaven saying, ‘Thank you,’ just like in Jericho. God had always given me what I wanted.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang said, “Well, upstairs, God was saying, ‘Hey listen, I’m telling you if you put your shoes back on and go back home, I could have moved things a lot faster.’ I have prepared another building for you.”</p>
<p>Soon after, Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson found another location for their university. The building was not officially for rent but Dr. Dang insisted that they call it’s real estate agent.</p>
<p>“The building had no sign on it. It was a restaurant that you (Dr. Dang) made me go inside of with no sign on it. You made me call the real estate agent with no sign on it and the real estate agent asked me, ‘Are you crazy? There’s no sign on it,’” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang replied, “But guess what? It was available and it had a parking lot!”</p>
<p>God is patient towards all of us. When God has something for you, it’s always going to be better than what you’ve dreamed of. If He does not give you what you want at the moment, He is preparing something for you down the road that will be ten times better that what you expected.</p>

" AUHS Celebrates the Past, Present and Future at Alumni Night",https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-celebrates-past-present-future-alumni-night/,,University News,"<div id=""attachment_6073"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6073"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6073"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/groupic.alumninight-300x275.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""275""><p id=""caption-attachment-6073"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS alumni return to their alma mater to celebrate Alumni Night on March 17, 2017.</p></div>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) graduates were cordially invited to the annual AUHS Alumni night to reconnect with their peers and celebrate their success on Friday, March 17, 2017. Building 2 of the university campus came alive with disco lights and old-school hip-hop songs like “Bust A Move” by, Young MC and “Ice Ice Baby” by, Vanilla Ice. Over 50 AUHS alumni attended the event wearing their best suits and dresses. AUHS President Dr. Caroll Ryan, attended the event to deliver the opening statements of the evening.</p>
<p>“I’ve only been with AUHS for a little over a month but that doesn’t matter tonight because our relationship goes forward from here,” said Dr. Ryan, “I’m so glad that you are staying connected with the university and I want to stay connected with you and everything that you are doing because we have many great things to accomplish ahead!”</p>
<p>Dr. David Hawkins, the AUHS Dean of Pharmacy, announced the university’s vision for the future and plans to create a School of Pharmacy program.</p>
<p>“Nursing has done very well in AUHS for many years and I’m very excited about the addition of pharmacy to this university,” said Dr. Hawkins.</p>
<p>Dr. Hawkins explained how he had been an academic instructor for 41 years and one of the things he enjoyed the most was the interactions that occurred between students of “different disciplines.”</p>
<p>“Years ago, the Institute of Medicine made it very clear that patient care should be team based. It takes nurses, it takes physicians, it takes pharmacists, it takes people of different health professions, to deliver the best care to our patients,” said Dr. Hawkins, “One of the things that I have tried to do in my academic career is to get pharmacy students, medical students and nursing students together in class so there is interprofessional education that prepares them for and interprofessional practice. We plan to submit our application to the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education by January 2019.”</p>

<p>The next speaker of of the event was AUHS alumni Robert Gommez. When he was 17-years-old, Gommez attended the AUHS high school Pharm Tech Regional Occupational Program (ROP) in 2004. After Gommez graduated high school, he then went to UC Irvine (UCI) to study for his Bachelor’s Degree in Social Sciences. He got a job at UCI while studying for his degree which helped pay two-thirds of his tuition. Gommez “worked his way up” and has served UCI for 11 years as a clinical informaticist for electronic medical records (EMR).</p>
<p>AUHS alumni Gabriela Lara was in the same high school ROP program as Gommez and she shared how she was accepted into the program.</p>
<p>“We had to do a very intense interview with (AUHS Co-founder) Pastor Johnson and (AUHS Founder) Dr. Dang (Hon.) so it wasn’t the easiest interview to pass,” Lara said, “But for the past 11 years, I have been working in everything related to the pharmacy field. Last year, I left pharmacy and I am now working under Molina Healthcare as a business analyst for their government contracts.”</p>
<p>After listening to speeches from their fellow alumni, guests poured each other a glass of wine and hit the dance floor. Alumni had the opportunity to catch up with old friends and make new connections. It was a night of dancing, laughter and nostalgia.</p>
<p>Guests were served salmon, baked chicken, rice and mixed vegetables for dinner. Towards the end of their meal, Maria Maloles, the AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications, held a raffle and gave winners gift cards for Starbucks, Target, and more.</p>
<p>At the end of the event, Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Amarri Sanders, an AUHS Student Success Coordinator announced that the university was in the process of creating an Alumni Association.</p>
<p>“We are starting a new Alumni Association. We would love your thoughts, collaborations and communication,” said Jura, “We are hoping that there will be a bridge between current and past students so you, (the alumni), can help and influence other students.”</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6072"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dinner3-300x198.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""198"">The Alumni Association could also help graduates find job opportunities, according to Jura. Jura hope that the Alumni Association will grow and have different regional chapters for alumni who are from the Los Angeles area, alumni who are from Orange County, alumni who are from out of state, and more. There will be a FaceBook group page and a LinkedIn in the near future.</p>
<p>“Please update your contact information and notify us if you changed your phone, email, or anything as far as us reaching you,” said Sanders, “We want to stay connected with you. You do not understand how much influence you have on those who have not graduated yet and how much you will be able to help those future graduates.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) nursing students visited a local convalescent home to read poetry to elderly patients. Dr. Christina Baker, an AUHS General Studies Professor, took her English 207 Creative Writing class to the Courtyard Care Center in Signal Hill, Ca for a class assignment called “An Hour of Poetry” on Tuesday, February 28, 2017. Thirty-one AUHS students gathered in the Courtyard Care Center’s activity room and read their original poems to the patients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“What I like about volunteering is that you get to give a little bit of yourself and you don’t know who’s life you’re going to touch,” said Dr. Baker, “When you think about a convalescent home, you think about how much elderly patients have lived through, what they have endured and how much respect they still deserve.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This was Dr. Baker’s third “An Hour of Poetry” event and she wanted it to become an AUHS tradition. About 3 courses ago, Dr. Baker realized that her creative writing class could do more for the community. She called the Courtyard Care Center and asked them if they would be interested in having students from AUHS read poetry to the patients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“Every time we go, the Courtyard ask our students to come back,” Dr. Baker said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Dr. Baker gave her students the creative freedom to write whatever their heart’s desire, but she asked them to be sensitive towards their listeners. She encouraged her students to write uplifting and inspiring poems because the patients may be depressed or in pain and would need something positive to brighten their day.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each of the students from Dr. Baker’s class was able to read their poems to the patients. AUHS nursing student Maria Jones was happy to have participated in Dr. Baker’s event and felt that she and her peers made a real difference in the Courtyard Care Center.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“It was a great experience to go and share our poems with the elderly patients. There was one particular lady who was cheering after every reading and it seemed like we made her day that day,” said Jones, “ My poem was about nature and beauty. I tried to make it short and sweet for the patients. The other poems were very comic and funny. There were even some students who sang and played music.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Jones is a licensed nurse who works in home health care.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“Although I do not work in a hospital, I read a lot to my clients. Reading to them out loud wakes up their senses, they become alert and would pay attention to what I’m saying,” Jones said, “I know art and poetry helps take me away from my problems for a little while. I know it does the same thing for my patients.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">AUHS nursing student Jennifer Valdez wrote a poem called, “A Day to Remember” which was about how her ten-year relationship was coming to an end. The patients responded well to her reading.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“The patients were very warm and loving towards (the students),” said Valdez, “The patients clapped for everybody and they were just excited to see and hear everybody’s poems.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Valdez believed that poetry was therapeutic and could help comfort the patients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“Poetry is therapeutic not only for the writer but for the readers and listeners as well. Because people can relate to some stories and it helps to know that you are not the only one going through stuff,” said Valdez, “Knowing somebody else is there with you helps release some of that stress.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Valdez worked in a hospital and doing something as simple as drawing a smiley face on a board or humming a familiar tune goes a long way in showing how much she cared for her patients. The most important part of “An Hour of Poetry” was for the students to show the elderly patients that they cared for them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">AUHS nursing student Kenya Smith from Cohort 16 is also an LVN (Licensed Vocational Nurse) and had experience working in a convalescent home.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;“I have worked in a convalescent before and sometimes you have patients that don’t get any visits. They don’t see their family and their only real communication or engagement they have is with people that work at the facility,” Smith said, “When you have outside people coming in and spending their time smiling and hugging the patients, it makes a big difference. A lot of students (at the “An Hour of Poetry” event) went out and gave the patients a therapeutic touch, a handshake and a smile. The patients were receptive, they were aware of what was happening around them and you could tell that it touched them.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Many of the poems AUHS students read to the patients were relative to their patient’s lives, according to Smith. A couple people wrote about their grandparents and Smith wrote a poem called, “Windows of Time.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“‘Windows of Time’ is about the evolution of a person from birth to his or her final stage in life. I thought it went hand-in-hand with being at the convalescent home because the patients were at their geriatric phase, which is the end of life,” said Smith, “But I wrote my poem in a way that showed how the person was still growing and blossoming, even at that stage of life.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Being a nurse meant more than just medical treatment, it was about making a human connection with their patients, according to Smith.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“I don’t believe it’s just the medicine. I believe nursing is holistic. That’s the approach I take with working with patients is that you’re more than just the medical portion, you are there for their psychosocial well-being, you are there for their nutrition, and so on. It’s a totality of services that you’re bringing to their lives.”</p>

This holiday had been celebrated in Ireland for over a thousand years in observance of the Catholic feast day of St. Patrick, who died on March 17, 461. St. Patrick is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland. St. Patrick’s Day was officially recognized as a celebration of Irish culture in the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Here are ten interesting facts that you probably didn’t know about this vividly green, Irish-themed holiday!</p>
<ol>
<li>Patrick’s birth name was Maewyn Succat. He was born in the late 4th century in Britain.</li>
<li>When he was 16 years old, Irish raiders attacked Patrick’s family’s estate and took him prisoner. They transported him to Ireland where he was held captive for six years.</li>
<li>During his captivity, St. Patrick began to have dreams of and visions of angels and the voice of God, telling him to convert Irish people to Christianity.</li>
<li>Patrick used the shamrock to preach about the Holy Trinity. He explained how just like the three leaves of the shamrock, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit could be separate entities, yet they are one in the same.</li>
<li>Patrick’s color is blue, not green. There are several artworks depicting the saint in blue robes.</li>
<li>There are more than 100 St. Patrick’s Day parades held in the United States; the biggest celebrations are in New York City and Boston.</li>
<li>Chicago began the annual tradition of dyeing the Chicago River green on Saint Patrick’s Day in 1962.</li>
<li>There are 34.7 million U.S. residents with Irish ancestry which is more than seven times the population of Ireland itself.</li>
<li>The first St. Patrick’s Day parade took place in New York City when Irish soldiers serving in the English military on March 17, 1762.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as a female leprechaun, according to Irish folklore.</li>

 AUHS Students Receives Valuable Career Advice at Employer Panel,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-students-receives-valuable-career-advice-employer-panel/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp"">
<div id=""attachment_6038"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6038"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6038"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Employer-Panel-pic-300x213.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""213""><p id=""caption-attachment-6038"" class=""wp-caption-text"">(Left to Right) AUHS Director of Affiliations Chantal Jura, Salvation Army Program Manager David Schwarm, Mayor of Signal Hill Lori Woods, DaVita Recruiting Manager Haley Mehren, and DaVita Regional Operations Director Ryan Welter.</p></div>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) was blessed to have had Signal Hill Mayor Lori Woods and representatives from DaVita and the Salvation Army as guests for its very first Employer Panel on Monday, March 13, 2017. AUHS students gathered in Building 2 of AUHS’ campus to become inspired, learn about new and exciting job opportunities, and obtain valuable career advice.Mayor Woods thanked AUHS nursing students for choosing a “field of compassionate care” for individuals who are sick and in pain.</p>
<p>“Nursing is much needed in the community, there’s a lot of demand but it takes a very special person to fill that demand,” said Mayor Woods, “We are very happy to have AUHS as part of our Signal Hill community. You, (the students), will be a valued asset to any employer that hires you based on your education at AUHS.”</p>
<p>Mayor Woods said that she admired how AUHS students chose to attend a university that was “distinctively Christian” and that she also received her higher education through a private Christian university. Mayor Woods then extended a hand of possible collaboration between AUHS and the city of Signal Hill.</p>
<p>“I just found out that you, (AUHS students), need 100 community service hours, so maybe we can partner,” said Mayor Woods.</p>
<p>Mayor Woods discussed several volunteer opportunities for AUHS nursing students such as after school programs or larger events like the Mayor’s clean-up and the city’s bimonthly senior food distribution program.</p>
<p>Mayor Woods informed AUHS students that nurses can find career opportunities not only in hospitals but in their government as well. The public health department is an area in government that focuses on the general health issues of society such as helping to prevent to spread of disease, protecting the quality of food and water, promoting better health to the community, etc.</p>
<p>“Signal Hill is really small so we don’t have our own health department but Long Beach does. LA County has a large health department,” said Mayor Woods “You might want to consider looking into some municipal or city services that would also provide and hire those in the health care and nursing field. There are good, stable jobs in municipal government and health departments.”</p>
<p>David Schwarm, Program Manager for the Salvation Army was also present at the AUHS Employer Panel to discuss his organization’s work culture and current job opportunities.</p>
<p>“The Salvation Army is more than just a thrift store, it is an international denomination. The Salvation Army has churches in over 160 countries and they do work all over the world,” said Schwarm, “One of the things they have done since the early 1900’s are summer camps.”</p>
<div id=""attachment_6039"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6039"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6039"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Employer-Panel-room2-300x204.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""204""><p id=""caption-attachment-6039"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Students gather at the AUHS Employer Panel on March 13, 2017.</p></div>
<p>The summer camp that Schwarm works for is <a href=""http://campmtcrags.com/"">Mt. Craggs</a> which was established in 1939. This summer camp serves up to 2 thousand campers every summer, according to Schwarm.“So being that (Mt. Craggs) is part of the Salvation Army, the goal of the camp is to serve primarily underserved kids. A lot of kids from inner-city LA and all sort of areas that don’t have opportunities to go out in nature or go out and camp for a week,” said Schwarm, “Everything is subsidized through the Salvation Army. Depending on the income of the church that they register with, the camper only has to pay $5, $50 or $150.”</p>
<p>Schwarm told the room that Mt. Craggs was hiring for a head nurse and an assistant nurse for this year’s summer camp (from June 12- August 5, 2017). The head nurse and assistant nurse must tend to children ages 8-17. Those who apply for the head nurse position are required to have a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN). Those who apply for the assistant nurse position are only required to have first aid and CPR certification.</p>
<p>“The head nurse has to be like a school nurse. You have to like children and deal with a lot of homesickness and tummy aches. There’s going to be scraped knees, bee stings, insect bites, and other things that you would encounter at a summer camp,” said Schwarm, “A big responsibility is the distribution of medication. Unfortunately, the demographic that we serve comes to camp with cocktails full of medications.”</p>
<p>Haley Mehren, the Recruiting Manager for DaVita was also part of the Employer Panel. DaVita was a fortune 200 company and the largest dialysis provider in the country, according to Mehren. DaVita was in 13 different countries across the world, had 3,300 clinics across American and had about 200 clinics in Southern California.</p>
<p>“I am a nurse as well, I didn’t get out of nursing school and dream that I would be a recruiting manager one day but it’s great work. I love being able to recruit nurses and it’s a really good place to have nurses learn and develop and grow in their careers,” said Mehren.</p>
<p>Dialysis had a couple of different modalities, the first being in-center dialysis.</p>
<p>“In-center dialysis are for patients who are either living at home or are living at a skilled nursing facility and they come in our centers 3 days a week for their dialysis treatments. That’s the bulk of what we do at DaVita,” said Mehren, “What’s great about in-center dialysis is that it’s really a team environment. You’re working with the same group of teammates everyday and you get to work with the same patients everyday so you get to know them really well. It becomes almost like a second family.”</p>
<p>The second modality for dialysis is called acute dialysis which is in a hospital setting.</p>
<p>“Acute dialysis is for patients who are either on dialysis chronically or have patients who have acute kidney injury and need to have a dialysis treatment while they’re in the hospital,” said Mehren, “It’s very different from in-center because it’s pretty fast pace and everyday is a little bit different. You never know what patient is going to pop up and need a dialysis treatment.”</p>

 AUHS Nursing Students Plays Board Game to Study for Finals,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-nursing-students-plays-board-game-study-finals/,,University News,"<div id=""attachment_6035"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6035"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6035"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/boardgame-300x198.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""198""><p id=""caption-attachment-6035"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS nursing students from Cohort 19 play a board game to review for this week’s finals.</p></div>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) kicked off the Winter 2017 finals week with fun and games! Tracey Flores, AUHS Nursing Faculty and Skills Lab Coordinator, offered her Medical Surgery class an alternative study method by introducing them to a board game called “RNtertainment: The NCLEX Examination Review Game” on Monday, March 13, 2017.</p>
<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p>“When we have clinical makeups, one of the things that we do for our students is provide them different modalities of learning,” said Flores, “Instead of just incorporating your traditional powerpoints and DVDs, this board game will help students review for their final.”</p>
<p>The NCLEX Examination Review Game was a “nationally recognized game” and had 800 clinical questions that would be similar to what will be on final exam, according to Flores. The board game could also help students prepare for the NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) because it covers the 4 major areas of the exam: safe and effective environment, psychosocial integrity, health promotion and maintenance, and physiological integrity. The board game also incorporates helpful test-taking tips.</p>
<p>“These questions are tough. They are not easy and they are very much NCLEX style. This tends to be the best game for really learning how to answer questions on the NCLEX exam, which is so important for our students,” said Flores.</p>
<p>Flores gives students an opportunity to play this game once every term. She said playing the NCLEX Examination Review Game is beneficial for her students because when people study in groups, they retain 70% of the information. If there is a teacher, (or someone that who knows the correct answers and could explain the rationale for the questions), people retain 90% of the information, according to Flores.</p>
<p>Flores also gave her students a chance to make up for any missing clinical hours by playing this board game. Her students played the NCLEX Examination Review Game for 3 hours. AUHS nursing student Emmanuelle De Castro from Cohort 19 enjoyed the activity and felt it helped her greatly in her review for the final exam.</p>
<p>“It’s a fun way to review the final. The rationales of some of the answers that we answered incorrectly helps us a lot,” said De Castro, “(The game) goes over what we learned (in class) like how nursing priority is how we should address the questions.”</p>
<p>De Castro often studies on her own by watching videos on YouTube and reading the assigned textbooks. But once she understands the subject on her own, she would find a study group to better enhance her review. She recommends this game to AUHS students who are close to their cohort because “it’s a really fun and helpful way to review with friends.”</p>
<p>AUHS nursing student Reggie Del Rosario from Cohort 19 was in the same class as De Castro. It was Del Rosario’s first time playing a game related to nursing.</p>
<p>“We’re having fun and we’re learning at the same time so it’s actually going to stick for me,” Del Rosario said, “It’s really reinforcing what we had been already learning.”</p>
<p>Del Rosario enjoyed playing the NCLEX Examination Review Game so much that he and some of his peers are thinking of buying the game for themselves.</p>

 The Art of Nursing – AUHS Students Showcase Drawings in Annual Artology Show,https://news.auhs.edu/art-nursing-auhs-students-showcase-drawings-annual-artology-show/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp"">
<div class=""mceTemp"">
<div id=""attachment_6031"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-6031"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-6031"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Art300class-300x191.jpg"" alt=""AUHS Professor Yuki Toyooka and her Art 300 Medical Illustrations class."" width=""300"" height=""191""><p id=""caption-attachment-6031"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS Professor Yuki Toyooka and her Art 300 Medical Illustrations class.</p></div>
<p>Nursing students from American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) gathered in their Medical Illustrations class to admire one another’s works of art. The classroom walls came alive with pencil drawings of a boy walking through a long and lonely road, a U.S. veteran saluting his flag, a veiled woman holding a severed heart in her hand, and much more. AUHS Professor Yuki Toyooka and her Art 300 class held the annual Artology show on Tuesday, March 14, 2017, on AUHS campus. The theme for this quarter’s Artology show was self-realization.There are many people who believe that nurses only have to be concerned with science and mathematics and that art was unnecessary. However, Toyooka believed that art is therapeutic and could be used as a means for nurses to better understand their patients.</p>
<p>“When you become a nurse you always have to think about what the other person’s thinking. You cannot be selfish or stubborn about your opinion,” said Toyooka, “I think art definitely helps you to have a flexible mind and allows you to have good communication with others.”</p>
<p>Toyooka selected the top three drawings from the class and awarded the artists with gift certificates. Reggie Del Rosario from Cohort 19 was awarded 7th place for “Best Works” in the Artology show. His concept of self-realization was to draw a picture of himself removing a mask.</p>
<p>“For as long as I could remember, I would have different personalities and I would have to put on a different face for everybody,” said Del Rosario, “When I finished high school, I was able to take off the mask and show who I really was. I didn’t have to please anybody.”</p>
<p>This was Del Rosario’s first art class and he feels he has grown not only as an artist but as a nurse as well. The class inspired him to go art shows and give him the ability to talk to other people about art.</p>
<p>“At first I didn’t realize why we, as nursing students, had to take art. I just thought it was an elective,” said Del Rosario, “But then I realized, there is an art to everything. You can’t just inject a patient carelessly. You have to do it carefully, like an artist.”</p>
<p>AUHS nursing student Mika Carrillo from Cohort 19 won third place at the artology show. Her drawing was inspired by her time at AUHS and is a reflection of her journey of becoming a nurse. Carrillo’s drew a self portrait of her wearing her nursing uniform and sunglasses.</p>
<p>“The reflection on the left side (of the sunglasses) revolves on the reality of nursing school. It’s just me, really tired and exhausted,” said Carrillo, “On the right side is how I hope to be in the future- to be a successful nurse.”</p>
<p>On the right side of Carrillo’s drawing, there is a hand surrounded in the words “love,” “friends,” and “family” reaching to her.</p>
<p>“The hand represents support from my boyfriend, friends and family because throughout all this, they are the ones I need to thank so much because they are the ones who have been supporting me and encouraging me through my journey,” Carrillo said, “AUHS has been a huge part of my life but what also matters is that despite the hardships I had, it’s important to remember the people who get you through it.”</p>
<p>Carrillo enjoyed Toyooka’s class and said it was “very relaxing.” She used to draw anime when she was younger and Carillo was happy to become creative again.</p>
<p>“For me art is therapeutic so me doing this on the side also helps me to relax. I draw when I take a break from studying for my nursing classes,” Carrillo said.</p>
<p>The first place winner of the artology show was Emmanuelle De Castro from Cohort 19. De Castro drew the heads of two women, back-to-back. On the left side of the drawing, she drew a woman with her eyes closed, head down and had a melancholic expression on her face. She also drew dark clouds, rain and a wilted flower on the left side of the page.</p>
<p>On the right side of De Castro’s illustration, she drew a woman with her eyes open, had her head held high and had a strong, confident expression on her face. There was also a rose in full bloom and sunlight breaking through the clouds.</p>
<p>“I basically drew what people typically think and go through in life. Even though you’re the strongest person in the world, you will cry sometimes,” said De Castro, “On the left side, it represents how everything goes wrong in life. On the right side, she’s looking up. She’s ready to face whatever challenges there are in life. It means the road is not going to be smooth but we just have to keep going.”</p>
<p>De Castro believed that “nursing is a passion” and people who want to become a nurse should not do it solely for the money. She thinks nurses should have the same passion for their patients the same way an artist is passionate for creating art. Just like art, nursing is also about making a connection with others.</p>

 Visions and Dreams,https://news.auhs.edu/visions-dreams/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Dr. Sisi Chen, AUHS Director of Institutional Research and Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Bible. The attendees took turns to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:5</strong> <em>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.</em></p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson, Co-founder of AUHS, emphasized the importance to seeking wisdom in order to relate with one another, better communicate and support one another as a University and as fellow Christians.</p>
<p>“2017 is going to be an incredible year for all of us. I know how blessed all of us are going to be and I know how much we are going to grow. So we really need wisdom in our communication with each other. We need wisdom in our love for each other,” said Pastor Johnson, “Wisdom is such that when you seek wisdom from God, God will help you navigate. Let’s encourage one another, let’s support one another, let’s help one another.”</p>
<p>God often gives us wisdom through trials and tribulations.</p>
<p>“God always put us in a place where we will be tested for our weaknesses,” said Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), Founder of AUHS, “If we do not have patience, God is going to surround us with people who will test our patience. If we have anger issues, He is going to put us around people that will make us see red. Because that’s how we learn.”</p>
<p>The key to God’s wisdom is through understanding when that wisdom should be applied, said Dr. Dang. Understanding God’s wisdom allows us to know when it’s the right time to act and what are the right words to say and when to apply what you have learned.</p>
<p><strong>Habakkuk 2:2-3 </strong><em>And the Lord answered me: “Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it. For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end- it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.</em></p>
<p>It is beneficial to write down your hopes, dreams and aspirations so one day you can look back and see how far you’ve come and if your prayers had been answered.</p>
<p>“If you have anything in your heart, don’t let it sit there! Let it out, say it, ask for it, and it will become reality. Like all things in life, it will take time but you can make it happen one day at a time,” said Aya Almukhtar, AUHS Admissions Coordinator, “Even when you are not clear on what you want, ask God for His wisdom. Always ask Him, ‘Please God, show me clarity, show me the path, give me the reasons and the signs. Send the right people in my path to make my dreams come true.”</p>
<p>If you care for someone, it’s our duty as Christians to do all you can to lift them up and make their dreams come true. Encourage one another as you would encourage your own family members.</p>
<p>“I would never say to my children that they are worthless. I would never say to them that they will not be successful. I would never say to them that they can’t do this, there’s something wrong with them,” said Pastor Johnson, “I’m going to say to them that you can do as much as you want to do, you are going to be greater than I had ever imagined.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson shared the hopes and dreams he had for his children. His youngest child, Temujin, is the birth name of Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>“Before Temujin was born, I wanted to have a child that would go to China to take the gospel,” said Pastor Johnson, “Genghis Khan conquered China so Temujin was named so he would to go to China, take the gospel and conquer it. That is what he’s named to do, that is what he’s inept to do.</p>
<p>He then talked about his vision for his daughter, Alexandria.</p>
<p>“Alexandria is beautiful. Before she was born I asked God to give me a prophetess who would be beautiful and comely so that men would see her and listen and then she would speak to them the words of God,” Pastor Johnson said, “You have to get people’s attention. Get their attention, and then speak.”</p>
<p>It all begins with a thought. Everything that we say becomes reality. Be mindful of how God answers our prayers.</p>
<p>“Whatever makes us happy, I really believe God delights in giving it to us,” Pastor Johnson said, “I’m not one of those people that believe our God is a bad dad. Our God is not a stingy dad. He’s a great dad and He’s a loving dad. He’s a much better father than me and I love my children.”</p>
<p><strong>Acts 2:17</strong> <em>And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</em></p>
<p>“This is powerful because we think dreams are for young people but not for old people,” said Dr. Dianna Scherlin, AUHS Provost, “God is there in the beginning, God is there at the end and He is waiting for us. When we’re done our dreams, our visions, our hopes will be given to us.”</p>
<p>It may take time for our dreams to become actualized and our prayers to be answered.</p>
<p>“Our time is on God’s time, our way is not God’s way. We may think we know God but we don’t know what He is thinking and what His perfect plan is for you,” said Dr. Dang, “The things that we want, a lot of time if it’s good, if it’s noble and if it’s it’s according to the bible, He’ll give it to us at the right time at the right place.”</p>
<p>The reason why people think God is slow to answer our prayers because we want it today. But things that seem slow for us is slow for a reason, according to Dang.</p>
<p>“We need to clean out whatever it is we need to clean out so that by time God gives it to us, we hold it and we can bless other people with it,” said Dr. Dang, “It took us 6 long years to get the nursing approval from the Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) because we were an anomaly.”</p>
<p>When Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson started AUHS in 1994, the BRN only gave BSN programs to non-profit or state schools.</p>
<p>“AUHS was weird to them, we weren’t like any other school,” said Dr. Dang, “We took a beating, they told us to get out of their backyard and go somewhere where there were no other nursing programs.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson went through many trials and tribulations when they first started AUHS.</p>
<p>“Some people who gave us a support letter told us they had to take it back because other people who were higher-up told them that they can’t give it to us. God took us through 6 whole years of people saying ‘No,’” Dr. Dang said, “But if we didn’t have that experience, we wouldn’t have tried CCNE and we would not have attempted to deal with WASC because we would have thought that we were too small, we don’t have the capacity, ability, and we didn’t look like everybody else. We would have stopped that dream.”</p>
<p>But Dr. Dang and Pastor Johnson were blessed with people who supported AUHS like Kaiser Permanente and RAND Corporation. The Director of RAND even sat before the Board of Registered Nursing in support of AUHS.</p>
<p>“The other for-profit schools weren’t there. West Coast didn’t exist, National didn’t exist, none of them existed. For-profits were not in the realm of the Bachelors in Nursing. AUHS opened the door for all of them,” said Pastor Johnson.</p>

 AUHS Board of Trustees Meeting on University Governance,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-board-trustees-meeting-university-governance/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp"">

<p>The American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) Board of Trustees had a five hour meeting where they analyzed reports and discussed the future of the university. This was the first of four meetings the Board of Trustees had every year. Board of Trustees Chair Sara Pol Lim,&nbsp; AUHS Co-founder and Board of Trustees Vice-Chair Pastor Gregory Johnson, AUHS Founder and Board of Trustees member Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), Board of Trustees member Atty. Johnny Griggs, Board of Trustees member Dr. Song Tan, and Board of Trustees member Tamara Whitman gathered in the 2nd Floor Conference room at AUHS on Tuesday, February 7, 2017.AUHS Board members were given a presentation on university governance from Dr. Jill Derby, the Senior Consultant of AGB Consulting. Dr. Derby discussed the Board’s role and responsibilities, what the best practices were in university governance and ways of enhancing AUHS’ governance performance. She also discussed how imperative a university’s role is in society.</p>
<p>“Universities and colleges are very particular institutions in our society. It’s not like any other place or a business that produces widgets. The economic viability of communities and states and nations depend on our higher education institutions,” said Dr. Derby, “Just like the courts, just like churches, universities and colleges are held in very high esteem in society and there’s more and more of a recognition around the world, that there’s an accountability required because of that.”</p>
<p>Dr. Derby discussed <a href=""https://www.agb.org/reports/2016/consequential-board-governance-in-public-higher-education-systems"">Consequential Board Governance</a>, a 2016 study where AGB examined 55 prominent higher education institutions.</p>

<p>“Boards used to be a little more passive and just listen to the reports, have a reception and go home. But (the Consequential Board Governance) report says it can’t be business as usual because of altered educational delivery methods, basic changes in financing, and rising expectations,” Dr. Derby said, “Boards have to be in the forefront of these changes and have to focus particularly on the strategic long-term issues.”Dr. Derby reminded the AUHS Board members that they were the “fiduciary body” of the university, which means the Board acts for the benefit of others, (their students, the public, etc.), whose welfare depends on their trust. Every trustee carries this fiduciary responsibility.</p>
<p>“It’s a legal responsibility because there are lawsuits than can come out of that, and it’s a moral responsibility,” Dr. Derby said.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees should not only focus on financial sustainability, soundness, and integrity but educational quality as well, according to Dr. Derby. There are three pillars of fiduciary responsibility. The first pillar is the duty of loyalty where a Board member must always act in the best interest of the University above all else. The second pillar is the duty of care, which requires a board member to be diligent in the duties of the duties engagement. Trustees must attend and be prepared for meetings and events. The third pillar is the duty of obedience where the Board of Trustees makes sure the university is in compliance, aligned with its mission and in tune with accreditation standards, requirements, and bylaws.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees had a serious fiduciary responsibility because it’s not only about individual students but it’s also about the good of the country. The big picture would be whether colleges and universities will be able to help produce enough healthcare providers and if they will be well enough trained. The welfare of the public depends on this, said Dr. Derby.</p>
<p>AUHS is a private, minority owned, minority serving, Christian-based university whose mission is to educate and equip students with life careers and to produce quality health care professionals for the community, the nation, and the world. It is a university where appreciation of life and one’s spiritual reason for existence can be nurtured.</p>

 The Forgiveness of Sins,https://news.auhs.edu/forgiveness-of-sins/,,Morning Dew,"<p>Led by Pastor Gregory Johnson, Co-founder</p>
<p><em>Though we stray at times from the Father, we are never too far away. For Him to come retrieve us, is from the place where sin does play.</em></p>
<p>We are the children of the most high God. No matter where we go in life, He is always there to guide us.</p>
<p>“God will push us to get us to where we need to go, God will give us grace and help us where we need to go, even when we move so slow,” said Pastor Johnson, “God figures out ways to bless us and show grace to us and have mercy on us.”</p>
<p>There are things we go through every day whether it’s from work, school, or even family, that distract us from God’s grace.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we get so stressed in life we just don’t think about God because we’re just trying to get what we have to get done,” said Brian Cuffey, AUHS Maintenance man, “God knows that we’re going to go back to Him, He’s waiting for us to go back to Him and when we do it’s pleasing to Him because we’re back on the right path.”</p>
<p>Human beings are flawed and one of our biggest flaws is that we think our sins are bigger than God’s love.</p>
<p>“Nothing that you and I do is bigger than the sacrifice that God has given us because to suggest that means you are bigger than God. To suggest that means you think you are greater than God,” Pastor Johnson said, “Anything you have done wrong yesterday, once you come to Christ, once you understand who Christ is, nothing is bigger than that. Nothing is bigger than his death and resurrection.”</p>
<p>Never get confused about who you are, never get confused about your past mistakes, never get confused about the things that you’ve done and the things that you will do because everybody is going to sin. But take comfort in the fact that God is bigger than our sins.</p>
<p><strong>Remembered- </strong><em>We’re remembered even in our folly, we’re remembered even in our faults, we’re remembered because the Lord has saved us, that salvation by His son was bought.</em></p>
<p>Humanity was reconciled with God through the death of His son, Jesus Christ. Through Him, all sins were forgiven.</p>
<p>“Everybody makes mistakes and God sent His son to save us. We sin but we should not intentionally sin,” said Dr. Mok Chong, the Dean of AUHS’ School of Pharmacy, “But as Pastor Johnson said, is our sins bigger than god? No. We should be comforted by His love.”</p>
<p>Although Christians strive to follow in Christ’s footsteps and become like God, we will make mistakes. But we can ask for forgiveness because He is always listening to us.</p>
<p>“I go to church and ask for forgiveness but I keep on doing the same thing over and over again. But I always say to Him, ‘Okay God, I’m here again praying for forgiveness. I keep doing the same thing but you’re still there blessing me everyday,’ said Maria Maloles, AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications, “God never gets tired of hearing our pleas.”</p>
<p>Whether we know it or not, God has a plan for us all. Everything happens for our own good because we are tailor-made by His hand.</p>
<p>“God’s plan for us is not only predestined but He tailors a plan for each of us by what we have experienced as well. By the folly he brings into our life, by the the faults and the mistakes we have made and by the way God has saved us,” said Dr. Sisi Chen, AUHS Director of Institutional Research and Assessment.</p>
<p>God does not forget us because we sin.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re ever forgotten by God no matter what happens. If you knew Him to begin with, it will come full circle and you’re always going to go back to Him,” said Amarri Sanders, AUHS Student Success Coordinator, “So always remember that He loves you and He’ll always remember you for sharing that love with Him.”</p>
<p>God allows us to experience both the good and bad in life so He can mold us, make us stronger and be an instrument to share His love with others. Hai Luong, AUHS Admissions Coordinator, referred to Romans 8:28 of the Old Testament- <em>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>“I used to think that only the good things will make up the bad things in my life,” said Luong, “Later, as I mature in Christ, as I go through experiences and bad things happened to me, I realized that God used those bad things to make and mold me into the person that he can use.”</p>
<p>Luong shared with the room how he was as a prison minister in San Quentin State Prison in San Francisco, California. He had served&nbsp; as a minister for three years bringing the word of God to convicted felons.</p>
<p>“I was in there with criminals, with people who was rejected by society. Even their families had rejected them. I talked to people who had not been visited by anyone in ten years,” Hai said, “I came in there and I became their family and they in turn responded to the caring the love of God. And there was change.”</p>
<p><strong>Not Forgotten- </strong><em>I know that I am imperfect, in fact, so very far from good. Indeed, in these my failures, I’m accused by many who would believe my sins are sufficient for my God to turn away. But they do not understand His love, while I forget, His love never strays.</em></p>
<p>“We can forget God but we are never forgotten by God,” said Pastor Johnson, “Even though we do wrong, we can only do but so much because we belong to Him. He can’t take us out, He can’t destroy us, He can’t end it because God is still perfecting us. We’re still being shaped by Him, we’re still being tailored by Him.”</p>
<p>God is always with us at the best of times and at the worst of times.</p>
<p>“Although we may forget God, we remember Him at our greatest time of need,” said Dr. Dianna Scherlin, AUHS Provost, “So when something bad happens to us, the first thing we say is ‘Oh God help me!’ and ‘Oh God why did this happen to me?’ In the heart of things we are thankful to God for our good fortune and we are questioning God when things don’t go well. He is the first person we reach to.”</p>
<p>We are imperfect but God accepts our imperfections.</p>
<p>“I’m always thinking about some of the mistakes I’ve made before and sometimes I pray to God about my failures and mistakes,” said Sherry Zhang, AUHS Administrative Assistant, “God is always trying to help me and He always gives me a chance to become better.”</p>

 AUHS’ Reflects on International Women’s Day,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-reflects-international-womens-day/,,University News,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5997"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/womensdaygraphic-300x164.jpg"" alt=""womensdaygraphic"" width=""300"" height=""164"">American University of Health Sciences’ (AUHS) faculty and staff celebrated the achievements and contributions of women all over the world on International Women’s Day on Wednesday, March 8, 2017.<br>
International Women’s Day is a day when people can “reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities,” according to the <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">United Nations</a>.</p>
<p>During Wednesday Noon Prayer, Chantal Jura, Director of Affiliations, asked her fellow employees to take a moment to reflect on International Women’s Day and to pray for their mothers, daughters and sisters.</p>
<p>“I think we should really think about International Women’s Day. Even if you’re not a woman, we all know someone who is a woman,” Jura said, “Please think of our daughters and our sisters. We should really think of their future and pray for that.”</p>
<p>Jura said that they were living in a period of transformation for women that will impact future generations. However, Jura fears there may not be a bright future because of the many challenges and opposition women continue to face today. The protection that women had for their rights, bodies, and ability to make choices was threatened, Jura said.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is still the only industrial country in the world to not have paid maternity leave. That’s really sad that as a woman, you cannot even take a break from work to have a child,” Jura said, “I’m sometimes a little bit scared what’s going to happen for my daughters. Are we going to go backwards or are we going to go forward?”</p>
<p>Jura is an advocate for paid maternity leave and breastfeeding in the workplace which she promotes on her own free time.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is still the only industrial country in the world to not have paid maternity leave,” Jura said, “That’s really sad that as a woman, you cannot even take a break from work to have a child. It doesn’t make any sense to me.”</p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson, AUHS Co-founder, also took time to acknowledge International Women’s Day during one of his meetings. While Pastor Johnson prayed for Tiffany V. Bradshaw, the California Director for the First Ladies Health Initiative, in the <a href=""/2017/03/09/auhs-collaborate-first-ladies-health-initiative/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">First Ladies Health Day meeting</a>, he also prayed for the health and well-being of women around the world.</p>
<p>“I just thank you oh Lord God for your daughter, (Bradshaw), for she is mindful of you for everything that she does. The work that she is doing nationally is a work that’s lead by your women of faith,” Pastor Johnson said, “It just so happens that it’s International Women’s Day. But is there anything on this that has not brought through your daughters, Lord God? Is there anything on this earth that is not birthed through the work of your daughters? So bless them Lord God, keep them safe, protect them from every evil, and keep them in good health.”</p>

 AUHS to Collaborate with First Ladies Health Initiative,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-collaborate-first-ladies-health-initiative/,,University News,"<div id=""attachment_5988"" style=""width: 286px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5988"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5988"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/LadiesFirstHealthDayno2-276x300.jpg"" alt=""(From left to right) Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of AUHS, Tiffany V.

Bradshaw, the California Director for the First Ladies Health Initiative, and Dr. Caroll Ryan, President of AUHS.</p></div>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) welcomed a representative of the <a href=""http://firstladieshealth.com/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">First Ladies Health</a> Initiative to discuss terms of collaboration on Wednesday, March 8, 2017. Tiffany V. Bradshaw, the California Director for the First Ladies Health Initiative met with Pastor Gregory Johnson, AUHS Co-founder, and his associates to discuss the Sixth Annual Los Angeles First Ladies Health Day.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles First Ladies Health Day is a citywide event that will provide free support services and health screenings to communities throughout Los Angeles County on Sunday, March 26, 2017.</p>
<p>“The First Ladies Health Initiative started in Chicago in 2008 because we understand that there’s a lot of people within certain communities who go to church but don’t go to the doctor,” Bradshaw said, “So we decided we need to bring the doctors to the church.”</p>
<p>Bradshaw explained how her organization collaborated with “the First Ladies of the churches,” meaning the pastor’s wives, female clergy members, etc. The First Ladies Initiative aimed to inspire women of Christ to use their influence to empower their congregations to reach out to their communities and spread health awareness. The First Ladies Initiative is sponsored by Walgreen’s Pharmacy and each of the participating churches with a location will have a Walgreen’s pharmacist on-site. They will provide free screenings for diabetes, blood pressure, mammograms, cholesterol, and more.</p>
<p>The First Ladies Health Day is an admirable yet ambitious task. 30 churches in the Los Angeles area will participate in this upcoming health day.</p>
<p>“It’s one thing if we had the event at one place, it would make it really simple. But having the same event on the same day at 30 locations means I need 30 of everything,” Bradshaw said.</p>
<p>In order for a major event like The First Ladies Health Day to be a success, Bradshaw hopes to partner and collaborate with health care providers, local community organizations and schools such as AUHS. She asked Pastor Johnson what services he could help provide for the Los Angeles First Ladies Health Day.</p>
<p>“This is the first (First Ladies Health Day) and moving forward, if we have more time to plan and coordinate for the event, I think we can make it more and more robust,” said Pastor Johnson, “I think we will get reasonable turnout but the more we have advanced notice, then we can plan it as a standing institutional-wide event.”</p>
<p>One of the locations for the Los Angeles First Ladies Health Day is the <a href=""http://antiochlb.com/our-pastors/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Antioch Church of Long Beach</a>. Pastor Johnson plans to meet with Pastor Wayne Chaney of Antioch Church to coordinate for this event. He said may be able to provide 40-50 AUHS nursing students to volunteer.</p>
<p>“I think we need to have a conversation with (Antioch) as quickly and as conveniently as possible so we will be able to coordinate, learn what they need and see what resources we can help provide,” Pastor Johnson said, “If they have everything they need, we can discuss how many nursing students we can put at different stations to assist.”</p>
<p>When Bradshaw mentioned that there will be a First Ladies Health Day in Orange County on April 30, 2017, Pastor Johnson asked why the event did not have a set date like International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>“If I’m going to have a First Ladies Health Day, I’m going to have a day for all the First Ladies in the world,” Pastor Johnson said, “If everybody in the country is doing First Ladies Health Day, you can go to different spots all over the U.S. and all of them will be talking about the same thing- health in the communities and the church’s responsibility to make the community healthier.”</p>
<p>Bradshaw appreciated Pastor Johnson’s enthusiasm and willingness to do more for the health of his community.</p>
<p>“This is the kind of partner that we need,” Bradshaw said, “Someone who comes in and says we should do First Ladies Health Day worldwide.”</p>

 Helpful Study Tips,https://news.auhs.edu/helpful-study-tips/,,Articles,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright wp-image-5985 size-medium"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AUHS-Portraits-3-10-10-139-1-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Helpful Study Tips"" width=""300"" height=""200""></p>
<p>The Winter 2017 Quarter is coming to an end and American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) wants its students to go out on a high note! Here are 10 helpful tips when studying for next week’s final exams.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write your notes by hand, not on your computer.</strong> According to an article from <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">npr.org</a>, students who took written notes by longhand are forced to paraphrase and summarize therefore the processing that occurs improves learning and retention.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t cram!</strong> According to an article from <a href=""http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2011/11/study-smart.aspx"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">apa.org</a>, “spacing out study sessions over a longer period of time improves long-term memory.” For example, if you have 14 hours to spend studying on a subject, it’s best to spread out this studying for the course of 2 weeks. Spend time studying the subject for an hour a day instead of cramming the night before.</li>
<li><strong>Review your notes in a quiet space</strong>. While you are studying, put yourself in an environment where there are little to no distractions. You can study in your room, a local library or even a park.</li>
<li><strong>Find a study partner!</strong> Studying with another person and explaining key points is a great way to help process the information for your exam.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t talk to the other students regarding what will be on the test.</strong> This will only make you more nervous and anxious.</li>
<li><strong>Test yourself.</strong> Use flashcards and take practice tests. In doing so you will be able to identify the gaps in your memory and spend your next study session trying to fill them, according to an article from <a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/gyanyankovich/study-test-study-test?utm_term=.wk72zQbkj#.mk2eMXkd6"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">buzzfeed.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get a good night’s rest.</strong> There is a strong connection between sleeping and learning, according to an article from <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-helps-learning-memory-201202154265"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">harvard.edu</a>. Even a brief nap may boost memory and problem-solving. Read your notes before you go to bed each night!</li>
<li><strong>Eat a healthy breakfast. </strong>What you eat and drink can affect your exam performance. Brain-boosting foods include eggs, nuts, whole-grain cereal, apples, oatmeal, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Make sure you are hydrated and drink plenty of water.</li>
<li><strong>Take a deep breath.</strong> Deep breathing will help prevent or help avoid “test anxiety.”</li>
<li><strong>Stay Positive!</strong> Your attitude can impact the effectiveness of your studying. Counter negative thoughts with positive thoughts. You’ll do great!</li>

 AUHS and Lafayette Elementary School on Serving Children in Need,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-lafayette-elementary-school-serving-children-need/,,University News,"<p><strong>Matthew 18:2-5</strong> <em>He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) welcomed representatives from Lafayette Elementary School to their campus on Wednesday, February 22, 2017. Lafayette Elementary School Principal, Wendy Thompson and Lafayette Elementary School Counselor, Nancy Rettig, met with AUHS Founder, Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.) and her associates in the 2nd Floor Conference room to discuss AUHS’ tutoring program and other services.AUHS has a tutoring program where the university’s students go to elementary schools, (such as Whittier Elementary School and Signal Hill Elementary School), and tutor science, mathematics and other subjects. Lafayette Elementary School expressed their interest in having AUHS provide their tutoring program to its students.</p>
<p>“We would love to provide our tutoring service for (Lafayette) but I want to know what your needs are so we can determine how many students we can provide,” Dr. Dang said, “A lot of our students have a heart to help others so that’s the reason why we wanted to offer this tutoring program as an opportunity for them to give back to the community.”</p>
<p>Lafayette Elementary School was built for 300 students but currently has one thousand. The school is “100 percent Title One,” meaning all the children that attend Lafayette are living below the poverty line, according to Thompson. Many Lafayette students live in hotels on Pacific Avenue and Magnolia and are chronically homeless. Lafayette has the highest transitory rate in the Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD) and they have the third highest rate of foster children.</p>
<p>Thompson’s mission as Lafayette’s school principal aligns with AUHS’ mission because she wants to do more than give her students an education.</p>
<p>“Our students are precious, they are eager and I know so capable. Our test scores have continued to climb so their intellectual fortitude is great but there are so many non-academic barriers. When basic needs are not provided, it’s very difficult to focus on your studies,” said Thompson, “You cannot learn when your belly is hungry, you cannot learn when you’re cold, when you don’t feel safe at home. There’s abuse, there’s violence and a lot of grief and loss. Their parents are incarcerated, their parents are murdered.”</p>
<p>Lafayette has many students that present behaviors that are related to trauma. Unfortunately, the basic needs of these children are often overlooked.</p>
<p>“When a student is hyper-vigilant, it gets misconstrued as ADHD,” said Thompson, “Some students are unrelenting to take of their backpack because everything they own is in their backpack. So we have to be sensitive to these thing and knowing the needs of our students allows us to serve them with a servant’s heart.”</p>
<p>Thompson believed that as a school and as a community, we have to do more for our children than just teaching them reading, writing, science, and mathematics skills. We have to learn and build relationships with the students and their families in order to better serve them. Although Thompson want to do more for her students, the sources for the school’s revenue decline every year.</p>
<p>“The funds for Title One program through the federal government are diminishing,” Thompson said, “And there’s declining enrollment in the district and less money is coming through the funding sources. But a lot of my school’s needs really have nothing really to do with money, they have to do with the need for hands. Tutoring isn’t really about money, per se. It’s about the necessity for human beings who can come and can work with the students.”</p>
<p>The Lafayette students who are in most need of AUHS’ tutors are students who are in danger of “being retained” which means a student cannot move on to the next grade if he or she does not meet certain standards. For example, in mathematics students must pass the basic math facts test. In reading, students can be no further than one year behind their reading level.</p>
<p>“Our first area of need would be helping those retention students get out of retention danger,” Thompson said, “If someone can come and listen to a student read, and help the student by asking some comprehension questions, help them with some strategies to help attack words and so forth, it would make a difference.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang commended Thompson’s efforts and assured her guests that the university’s tutors would be vetted and provide the care and commitment the children of Lafayette Elementary school needed. She told Thompson that AUHS wanted to make absolutely sure that it’s students “will be of help and not of hindrance” so it had created a criteria that determines whether or not its students are eligible to become tutors. The criteria includes GPA, proficiency in math, science and English, and much more. AUHS plans to provide 10 tutors for Lafayette Elementary School in May 2017.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang also said that when she started AUHS 23 years ago, their mission included a strong sense of social responsibility and community outreach. The university had collaborated with many elementary schools, middle schools and high schools in the past. AUHS had made many efforts to introduce children to the field of nursing and pharmacy, and to overall help enrich young minds with science and mathematics.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang discussed how AUHS collaborated with Charles F. Kettering Elementary school to create a Regional Occupational Program (ROP). The ROP was called “Pharmacy Technician.” For 12 years, AUHS recruited 20 students a year who were high achievers and identified themselves in wanting to pursue a career in the medical field.</p>
<p>“The students had to give up a lot because our program was a year long and they had to leave school early to come to us,” Dr. Dang said, “We had that agreement with the LA County Unified district for 12 years.”<br>
AUHS kept track of their students and discovered that 90 percent went to 4-year university, (the majority of them in health sciences), and 50 percent of the students became pharmacists, according to Dr. Dang.<br>
“The purpose of us doing this program is to increase awareness and also to give them experience that they need to really make a decision,” Dr. Dang said, “By the time they graduate high school, their resume will look great if they want to pursue a PharmD or pre-Pharm program because they had exposure and experience.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang also informed her guests of AUHS’ fourth annual A2i Summer Medical Camp that will take place in June 2017. AUHS is currently accepting applications from students grade 8-12. In this summer camp students learn medical terminology, pharmacology, dosage calculation, get CPR certification, learn basic physical diagnosis, and much more.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t cost much money, only an application fee. Some of the students qualify for a scholarship, so they get in for free,” said Dr. Dang, “It’s something we do for the community, it’s not meant for profit.”</p>
<p>The A2i Summer Med. Camp also provides a career day panel where students can meet health care professionals, (such as pharmacists, doctors, and ultrasound technicians), ask them questions about their field and learn essential career advice.</p>
<p>Students are also given fun hands-on activities such as making lip balms and bubble gum flavors.</p>
<p>“If we can motivate them to further their focus in health sciences then we’ve done our job,” Dr. Dang said.<br>
Dr. Dang also announced that AUHS will be hosting it’s very first free Book Fair in June 2017.</p>
<p>“I love books and I have three kids of my own and they love to go to the bookstore,” Dr. Dang said, “I know a lot of kids, if their income is not high, can’t afford to buy their own books. Scholastic people can be very expensive nowadays.”</p>
<p>AUHS is in the process of collecting new and gently used books for the upcoming Book Fair. The Book Fair will have the same voucher system as AUHS’ annual events such as Santa Cause and Acts of Love.</p>
<p>When Thompson and Rettig asked where AUHS received its funding for these charitable events, Dr. Dang said she never asked the state or federal government for money. AUHS was a for-profit university but it helped fund AUHS Foundation, a nonprofit organization that researches and helps relieves the suffering of the poor, the homeless and the underprivileged.</p>
<p>“We’re a Christian-based organization. I don’t know if you have a problem with that or not because you’re a public school but that is why we feel the need to help others, because of our faith,” Dr. Dang said, “I feel like my family and I have been very blessed so that’s why I wanted to give back the things that God has given me.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang said that she, AUHS and the AUHS Foundation does what it cans with what God has given them.</p>
<p>“I’ve never asked any federal government or any state or local agency for money because I feel that if I’m able to do this, then I’m going to do it. I don’t need to go ask for money just because I don’t want to use my own money,” Dr. Dang said, “If I’m going to give something to the community like toys, socks or food, it has to be something that I want to give to my own children.”</p>

 AUHS Vietnamese Open House,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-vietnamese-open-house/,,Event Summaries,"<div id=""attachment_5977"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5977"" loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5977 size-medium"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hai.pray_-300x173.jpg"" alt=""Admissions Counselor Hai Luong prays for attendees at AUHS’ last BSN Open House."" width=""300"" height=""173""><p id=""caption-attachment-5977"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Admissions Counselor Hai Luong prays for attendees at AUHS’ last BSN Open House.</p></div>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) is pleased to announce that it will be holding its very first BSN Open House for Vietnamese speakers on Saturday, May 6th, 2017 from 9 am- 12 pm. There will be the regular Open House for English-speakers on May 13, 2017 but AUHS seeks to serve and better educate prospective students on its School of Nursing (SON) program by presenting this information in their primary language, which is Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Open House project was introduced by Hai Luong, AUHS Admissions Counselor.</p>
<p>“We want to reach out to the Vietnamese community to get prospective students to contact us, get to know us and hopefully sign up with our program,” said Luong, “The reason why we made an Open House for Vietnamese speakers is because a lot of the prospective student’s parents only speak Vietnamese. A lot of these parents help make the final decision.”</p>
<p>Luong was inspired to create an Vietnamese Open House after discovering from AUHS Founder Dr. Kim Dang Johnson (Hon.) and AUHS Co-founder Pastor Gregory Johnson that the Vietnamese community helped the university grow and become what it is today.</p>
<p>“When Pastor Johnson and Ms. Kim started this university, they didn’t have many students calling in to inquire about their programs. They started out with having Vietnamese students joining the university,” Luong said, “What I got from Pastor Johnson and Dr. Dang is that because we started with the Vietnamese students, in a way we feel gratitude for the community. We want to go back into our roots and give back to the community for their support.”</p>
<p>The list of presenters at this upcoming AUHS Vietnamese Open House has not yet been finalized but Luong will be at the event to serve as a translator for the attendees. The “keynote speaker,” however, will be Pastor Johnson, said Luong.</p>
<p>This could be the first of many Open Houses where AUHS will provide translators for prospects whose primary language is Spanish, Tagalog, Khmer, and more. Luong also wants to make the same efforts to reach out to the Cambodian community and wishes to collaborate with Sara Pol Lim, the AUHS Chair of Board of Trustees, in the near future.</p>
<p>The majority of&nbsp; the Vietnamese population practices Buddhism or “ancestor worship” and only about 1-2 percent practice Christianity, according to Luong. However, Luong believes that even though most of Vietnamese people are not Christians, many of them consider Christianity and Christian establishments as trustworthy.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5978"" style=""width: 202px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5978"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5978"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/haiandhisguitar-192x300.jpg"" alt=""Hai Luong,AUHS Admissions Counselor."" width=""192"" height=""300""><p id=""caption-attachment-5978"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Hai Luong,AUHS Admissions Counselor.</p></div>
<p>“I had a prospective student who was Vietnamese and not Christian that came here a few months ago, asking about our BSN program. When I told him that we were a Christian University, he said that he had a good feeling about it,” Luong said, “I hope the rest of the Vietnamese community reacts the same way.”</p>
<p>Although it is a Christian institution, AUHS accepts students from all walks of life.</p>
<p>“We let people know that we’re a Christian university, we love God, we love people, we’re here to support them but we don’t discriminate against any religious or ethnic backgrounds,” said Luong, “We welcome everybody. We accept our students and love them just as they are.”</p>
<p>As a Christian university, AUHS not only provides the best medical training but it also provides the best emotional and spiritual support possible, which is important for many students.</p>
<p>“When I was a college student, things happened in my life. A loss of a friend or family member, sickness, and so on could cause crisis,” said&nbsp; Luong, “But having God and having Godly people around you to pray for you, to give you advice, to comfort you, and encourage you makes huge differences.”</p>

 AUHS Blood Drive 2017,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-blood-drive-2017/,,Event Summaries,"<p><strong>Leviticus 17:11</strong> <em>For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.</em></p>

<p>Sixty nursing students from American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) donated blood to the American Red Cross (ARC) on Monday, February 27, 2017. The Red Cross arrived on AUHS’ campus on a red and white mobile blood bus and parked beside Building 1. Students came as early as 9 am in the morning to donate. The students arrived with their peers, and others came on their own. There were students who had donated blood to the ARC several times before and there were those who came to donate blood for the very first time.“I’ve never donated blood before so I’m kind of excited,” said AUHS nursing student Sheena Spurling from Cohort 20, “I also work in a hospital so I see traumatic events where people need blood transfusions and I know there’s only a limited supply. I’ll keep doing it because I see patients need it all the time.”</p>
<p>Spurling expressed her admiration for the Red Cross and their contributions to community outreach and health care.</p>
<p>“I like the The Red Cross. They’re really friendly and I believe that they’re trying the best they can to go out there and help people,” Spurling said, “It’s not a selfish act, they’re trying to help all communities not just this one.”</p>
<p>Spurling applauded the collaboration between AUHS and the ARC. She liked how AUHS students were given the opportunity to not only make a difference in their local community but were able to “do something that may benefit somebody in a different state or a different town.”</p>

<p>AUHS nursing student Marilyn Alvarado from Cohort 16 also volunteered at AUHS’ Blood Drive and understood how the blood she donated today could help save a life tomorrow.“I decided to donate because I really like helping others and if my blood can help other people, I’m willing to do it not only today but in the future as well,” said Alvarado.</p>
<p>Alvarado worked in a medical-surgery unit at a hospital for her clinical hours at AUHS and experienced first-hand the patients who were extremely anemic and needed blood blood transfusions.</p>
<p>AUHS nursing student Katherine Perez-Tobar from Cohort 16 also works in an operating room unit in a hospital therefore donating blood is very dear to her heart because she sees how many of the patients that receive surgery need blood transfusions.</p>
<p>“I’ve decided to donate blood because I know it would benefit the community. I know how important these blood donations are for the recipients,” Perez-Tobar said.</p>
<p>Perez-Tobar believes that the AUHS Blood Drive is a great opportunity for AUHS students to make a difference and suggested that the Blood Drive should be open to the public so members of the Signal Hill and Long Beach communities could donate as well.</p>
<p>“Some people in the community do feel strongly about donating to help others,” Perez-Tobar said.</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) is pleased to announce our partnership with ManagEase, Incorporated. ManagEase visited AUHS’ campus and gave a presentation for AUHS faculty and staff in the 2nd Floor Conference Room on Thursday, February 23, 2017.</p>
<p>“We serve clients across all types of industries ranging from attorneys to manufacturing to schools,” said JeeAnn Petrina, the ManagEase Senior Director of HR and Payroll Services, “It’s a really exciting time for us to be able to work with AUHS and to get to know a little bit about your company, your schooling and how you guys run everything.”</p>
<p>Petrina began the presentation by discussing the history of her company. ManagEase has been in business since 1997 and is a leading HR outsource firm. They manage Human Resources (HR) for over 15,000 companies in America, according to Petrina. Although ManagEase is based in California, they have clients in different states, giving them knowledge of other state’s federal and regulatory laws.</p>
<p>Petrina explained what outsourcing does for companies and how ManagEase can be a good resource even though they will only be on site part-time.<br>
“It’s great to partner with companies who are able to provide excellent service,” said Petrina “ManagEase employees are certified either in HR and/or payroll. We have a compliance department as well as a benefits brokerage department. We are able to put that expertise together and serve our clients with that knowledge base.”</p>
<p>Petrina then discussed the contract AUHS currently has with ManagEase. ManagEase will be providing HR services to AUHS. They will be on AUHS campus one and a half days per week for the first two months and the third month they will be on-site two half days per week.</p>
<p>“I believe AUHS will be establishing an office for us and we will be building infrastructure for the HR department for your company,” Petrina said. “So we’re really excited to have a one-stop place to go to for employees and managers.”</p>
<p>Petrina introduced the two other ManagEase representatives that accompanied her in this meeting- Luis Cuellar, the ManagEase Director of HR Special Projects and Mariann Hernandez, the ManagEase Senior Manager of HR &amp; Payroll Services.</p>
<p>Cuellar is currently reviewing all aspects of AUHS’ HR and payroll compliance.</p>
<p>“I’m mainly working on the assessment for you guys now and trying to get you guys to where you want to be,” said Cuellar, “We have a lot of great information that we’ll present to your management team and I’m looking forward to taking care of a lot of those issues for you guys.”</p>
<p>Petrina informed the room that Hernandez will be AUHS’ on-site consultant. Hernandez has worked for ManagEase for over two years but has over 15 years of experience working in HR and payroll. Hernandez is fluid with the laws and regulations for the state of California.</p>
<p>“I’m really looking forward to getting to know all about AUHS and working extensively with your senior management staff and I really hope to get to know everybody,” Hernandez said, “This is a small group compared with other companies that I’ve worked with and it’s a nice for a change to work with a smaller group Once I’m here, please stop by and say, ‘Hello!'”</p>

<p>American Red Cross (ARC) visited American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) to discuss collaboration and brainstormed ideas on how AUHS students can become more involved with ARC. Three Red Cross representatives met with AUHS Co-founder Pastor Gregory Johnson and his associates in the university’s Second Floor Conference room on Thursday February 16, 2017.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson prayed for his guests, discussed AUHS’ mission statement, core values and university culture and extended a hand of friendship to the ARC.</p>
<p>“We would love to have American Red Cross to be here as part of our community,” Pastor Johnson said, “One of the strongest things we have as a university is our community engagement.”</p>
<p>AUHS has several community outreach events each year including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGFRfcJEZdE&amp;t=21s"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Acts of Love</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q18fYPYcOQw"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Giving Thanks</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL8rMT5FTew"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Health Fair</a>, where the university and its nursing students provides free groceries and health care services to low income families, the homeless and other needy individuals.</p>
<p>“The most important thing for me right now is what we do to exemplify those things that please God which means helping people, serving people, touching people’s lives, and encouraging them,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>AUHS not only encourages its students to strive for academic excellence, but to be patient, kind and compassionate nurses. AUHS students learn how to genuinely care for others by volunteering at the university’s community outreach events thus experiencing first-hand the social, economic and medical issues low income families and homeless individuals face each day.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson showed the ARC representatives pictures and videos of the university’s charitable events. He then asked his guests what they thought about having AUHS students volunteer for the Red Cross.</p>
<p>ARC Project Specialist Yara Badrakhan suggested that AUHS students could volunteer at the Red Cross’ <a href=""http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/fire/prevent-home-fire"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Home Fire campaign</a> where they would go door-to-door in different neighborhoods and ask people if they wanted a fire alarm installed in their homes.</p>
<p>“(Pastor Johnson) talked about wanting your students to actually see the community, be a part of it. The Home Fire campaign is that kind of event,” Badrakhan said, “We see so many heartfelt and successful stories of us installing an alarm one day and a week later, a fire occurs and the family is saved because of our alarms. This would be a great way for your students to get involved and be part of the community.”</p>
<p>Badrakhan also stated that the Red Cross would be willing to participate in AUHS’ Health Fair, Acts of Love and other events that will allow them to set up a booth and educate AUHS’ students and event participants about the many services the Red Cross provides such as <a href=""http://www.redcross.org/local/washington-dc/programs-services/military-families-services"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Service to the Armed Forces</a> (SAF), health and safety courses such as CPR training, and much more.</p>
<p>ARC Board Member Jeff Sakaguchi emphasized how the services provided by the Red Cross are “great community service tools” that will help people cope, prepare for and at least be aware of disasters whether it is a fire, an earthquake, an injury, etc. Just like AUHS, ARC keeps the most vulnerable members of our society in mind, especially during these disasters.</p>
<p>“Just being able to know what to do and how to respond in the event that there is a major disaster, like an earthquake, it is something that we really strive to have our most vulnerable communities be aware of,” Sakaguchi said, “It will take time to have a well-coordinated response and people need to have that preparedness built in otherwise they truly are at risk.”</p>
<p>ARC has another campaign called <a href=""http://preparesocal.org/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Prepare So-Cal</a> and part of this operation is to identify “vulnerable communities.” There are several factors of a vulnerable community including demographics, economic level, language, education, the structuring of that particular community, and so on. In LA county alone the Red Cross had identified 15 vulnerable communities including Bell Gardens and Compton.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is an organization that not only focuses on the health and safety of people in Southern California but seeks to help individuals from all over the world. ARC Faith Based Program Manager Osas Otasowie discussed how she and ARC’s International Services plan to host an event to promote their <a href=""http://restoringfamilylinksblog.com/about/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Restoring Family Links</a> service.</p>
<p>“The focus of this meeting is to discuss one of our services where we restore family links who had been separated because of war, disaster, or whatever it is,” Otasowie said, “If there’s anybody LA-based that needs to find a loved one anywhere in the world, we provide those services absolutely free.”</p>
<p>ARC plans to have the Restoring Family Links meeting in March or early April of this year but the location had not yet been decided. When Pastor Johnson mentioned that Long Beach was the most diverse city in America, Otasowie said the ARC might consider to have this meeting at AUHS.</p>
<p>“We would love to do that and if that’s something you’re open to,” Otasowie said, “We are looking for the right location, a way we can pull people from diverse cultures and just talk about (Restoring Family Links) and spread the awareness. ”</p>

 February 2017 BSN Open House,https://news.auhs.edu/february-2017-bsn-open-house/,,Event Summaries,"<p><strong>Philippians 1:6</strong> <em>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.</em></p>

<p>Over 100 prospective nursing students and their friends, family, and loved ones gathered at American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) for the quarterly BSN Open House on Saturday, February 11, 2017. Guests received an in-depth orientation on AUHS’ School of Nursing (SON) program. Prospects were shown how AUHS was unique from most nursing schools because it is a university that is inspired by Christian values and prepares students from diverse backgrounds to serve communities that are medically underserved. AUHS is a place that produces quality health care professionals whose ultimate goal is to preserve and nurture life.</p>
<p>At 8 am, first-time visitors attended a BSN Info session that was lead by Dina Hsu, Director of AUHS’ Admissions Department. Hsu discussed admissions requirements, clinical rotations, prerequisite courses, course structure, and more.</p>
<p>“This session is meant to give you a feel of our university. Our goal is to meet your needs,” said Hsu, “We will be very transparent in letting you know what the school offers and does not offer so you can make the best decision for yourself.”</p>
<p>Hsu explained to the prospects how many AUHS students share many similar traits.</p>
<p>“AUHS students want to serve. They want to serve you and they want to serve God,” Hsu said, “But we don’t only accept Christian students. The ultimate goal is to be a great nurse.”</p>
<p>AUHS is a minority-serving university that accepts students of all backgrounds. A student’s life experiences only enrich the university’s patient care experience because nurses do not get to pick who they serve in a clinical setting.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5944"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5944"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5944"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HaiLuong.OpenHouse-300x167.jpg"" alt=""AUHS Admissions Coordinator Hai Luong greets guests for the BSN Open House in AUHS’ main lobby."" width=""300"" height=""167""><p id=""caption-attachment-5944"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS Admissions Coordinator Hai Luong greets guests for the BSN Open House in AUHS’ main lobby.</p></div>
<p>Several current AUHS nursing students joined Hsu’s session so they could help answer prospect’s questions from a student’s point of view. AUHS students even stayed at the end of the session to answer any questions their guests had. Prospective students also had the opportunity to exchange emails with the AUHS students if they had any more questions about the university and the SON program later on.</p>
<p>One of the AUHS students who volunteered at this quarter’s Open House was Ronald Harrison. Harrison began his education at AUHS in 2013 and he plans to graduate this year with a Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing. Harrison planned to receive his RN license when was 22-years-old but life did not go according to this plan and he is now he was 31-years-old. He explained to the prospective students that “things just happen” and he needed to take a leave of absence from AUHS because of a family emergency. Harrison’s grandfather was very ill and he needed to take care of him. Harrison discussed how AUHS&nbsp; faculty and staff were able to help him during this difficult period in his life and how he was able to move forward.</p>
<p>“When you reach out to AUHS, they will try to accommodate you as best as possible,” Harrison said, “Everybody will be accommodated with the clinical schedule but I was taking care of my grandfather at the time and his condition just went from bad to worse, so I couldn’t do clinicals on certain days.”</p>
<p>AUHS recommended that Harrison should take a leave of absence.</p>
<p>“Taking a leave of absence is not what I wanted to do but it was probably the best thing that happened for me. I took a leave on Friday and my grandfather happened to have to go to the hospital on that following Monday,” Harrison said, “The most important thing to understand is that you can’t do things last minute. When I had family issues or when I expected things to change, the school knew about it because I wanted to keep them informed.”</p>
<p>Harrison encouraged prospective students to not be discouraged when they sometimes fail or feel like they are behind in life.</p>
<p>“I know we all have this idea of how we think we should finish and that’s not always the plan for our lives. But what we have in our mind is not always how the course works,” Harrison said, “I think what’s most important is to focus on is your goal. Just stay the course, it’s not always going to be easy. Your goal is to get your RN degree.”</p>

<p>At 10 am, AUHS Co-founder Pastor Gregory Johnson addressed prospective students and their loved ones in the 2nd Floor Conference room. Pastor Johnson discussed the university’s mission statement, plans for the future and unwavering dedication to God.</p>
<p>“As we go through journeys in life we start to question whether or not we can get to where we want to get to go. We start to wonder whether or not we are</p>
<p>going to be successful at the things that God has placed inside of us,” Pastor Johnson said, “But the one thing that I know that is truer than anything is that God is with me. Because God is with you there is nothing that is impossible for you to achieve. Everything that you have before you, every dream that you have before you, every hope that you have before you, God is with you. Everything that you do is going to be connected to that promise you have from God.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson told prospective students how he and his wife AUHS Interim President Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.) founded AUHS in 1994. He first explained how he and Dr. Dang met and that she came from a conservative Vietnamese family.</p>
<p>“When we had this dream to start this university we prayed, we fasted and I finally said ‘Yes,’” Pastor Johnson said, “When (Dr. Dang) started saying that we were together, most of her friends left because I’m black. She wanted the university and she’s so near and dear to me, she is so special to me, I said, ‘Yes.’ ”</p>
<p>Success did not come overnight. In the first year of starting the university, Pastor Johnson and Dr. Dang had to sleep on the floor of their office without a stove, a refrigerator or a shower. They bought a styrofoam container filled with ice to store their food, used an inflatable wading pool to bathe themselves in and would cook their meals on a single hot plate.</p>
<p>“Anything that you could imagine, God is with you. Anything that you ever want, God is with you. Don’t you ever let anyone tell you that you will not be successful because God is with you”, &nbsp;Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson revealed the university’s plan to include more curriculums in the near future. AUHS plans to include an RN to BSN program Summer 2017, a Masters of Science in Nursing program in Fall 2017, a Doctorate in Nursing Practice program in Spring 2018, and a PharmD program by Summer 2019.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson explained that it is AUHS’ vision to use the field of health care as a means of addressing social, economic and health care disparities in medically underserved areas and medically underserved populations, both locally and globally.</p>
<p>“When we talk about healthcare reform, we believe firmly that healthcare reform has to start with inclusion. So the more that you see diversity in healthcare, the more you see power in healthcare in that diversity, the more you’ll see reform,” Pastor Johnson said, “You have to sit at the conference tables, you have to be in the place of decision making so that you can improve health outcomes and unless you’re sitting there you don’t a chance to influence that. So you have to see yourself as a leader.”</p>

 AUHS on Library Lovers’ Month,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-library-lovers-month/,,University News,"<p>A university would not be complete without a library. In honor of Library Lover’s Month, American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) sends all its love and admiration to its very own librarian, Stephanie Lien.</p>
<p>“I think library love should be year round,” Lien said, “A lot of people don’t r<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5901"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Lien-254x300.jpg"" alt=""Lien"" width=""254"" height=""300"">ealize the kind of resources that libraries have. The role of public libraries has expanded from being just about books to being community centers with movies, game nights and more.”</p>
<p>Lien’s love for books began at a young age. When she was a teenager, Lien was an avid reader of J.K. Rowling’s <em>Harry Potter</em> series. Some of her all-time favorite novels are <em>The Messenger</em> by, Markus Zusak and <em>The Trial</em> by Franz Kafka. Lien also enjoys classic works from Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy. Recently, Lien has been reading nonfiction essays such as “Is Everything Determined?” by Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>Lien has her own personal library at home with a “never ending collection of books.” She has two full bookshelves and the rest of her collection is stacked on the floor.</p>
<p>Not only did Lien’s passion for reading influence her to become a librarian but her interest in helping others to obtain the same knowledge and information.</p>
<p>“Being a librarian means you’re exposed to a lot of different kinds of information,” Lien said, “I like the role of helping people find info either in personal interest and academic research.”</p>
<p>Lien explained how when she was a child, she said she wanted to get a “Masters in everything.”</p>
<p>“Obviously (getting a Masters in everything) isn’t possible,” Lien said, “But when you think of being a librarian, you can be knowledgeable with a lot of different fields because you have access to a lot of different information.”</p>
<p>The majority of the publications available in the AUHS library are related to healthcare and medical studies to better serve the university’s nursing students. Lien and AUHS Teaching Assistant Jeanetta Mastron have recently created five resource shelves that will help AUHS students in their academic research or serve as a supplement to their studies.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5900"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5900"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5900"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Personal.Interest.Shelf_-300x282.jpg"" alt=""Community Resources"" width=""300"" height=""282""><p id=""caption-attachment-5900"" class=""wp-caption-text"">The “Community Resources” shelf contains flyers and brochures about healthcare and medical services.</p></div>
<p>The first resource shelf that is available in the AUHS library is “Community Resources” which has flyers and brochures on topics such as health information for senior citizens, consumer health, and clinical trials. The “Community Resources” shelf even has a list of emergency hotlines for the Long Beach area including numbers for Alcoholics Anonymous, a child abuse hotline, a suicide hotline, and more.</p>
<p>The second resource shelf is the “New Periodical Arrivals” which holds the newest magazines and journals the university has received. These publications have been put out on display to make it easier for students to find them. This shelf includes publications from <em>NIH MedlinePlus</em>, <em>Minority Nurse, Medical Design Briefs, </em>etc.</p>
<p>The third resource shelf is called, “New Book Arrivals.” This shelf contains new books the university had received in the last month or so. Some books that are currently available on this shelf include <em>The Nurse Anesthesia Pocket Guide</em> by Lynn Fitzgerald Macksey, <em>Policy and Leadership</em> by Gayle Roux and Judith A. Halstead, the <em>2017 Oncology Nursing Drug Handbook</em> by Gail M. Wilkes and Margaret Barton-Burke, and much more.</p>
<p>“In the future, the ‘New Book Arrivals’ shelf will be more geared towards certain courses being taught at the university, so they can supplement what you would be learning in class,” said Lien, “You may be able to use these books for research papers or other academic projects.”</p>
<p>The fourth resource shelf is “Academic Resources.” The resources in this shelf show you how to use academic resources that are free to access of had been purchased by the University. The “Academic Resources” shelf has APA guide handouts and guides on how to on how to use online databases such as Journal Storage (JSTOR), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Avid Open Access. It also has guides on how to use MedLife Plus, PubMed, and more.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5899"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5899"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5899"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CommunityResouceShelf-300x169.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169""><p id=""caption-attachment-5899"" class=""wp-caption-text"">The “Personal Interest” shelf contains self-help, fiction and nonfiction books for your reading enjoyment.</p></div>
<p>The final resource shelf is “Personal Interests.” This section is mostly fiction and nonfiction books that do not necessarily fit anywhere in the AUHS library but are available for your reading enjoyment. Books include <em>Hard Choices</em> by Hillary Clinton, Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em>, self-help books, and more.</p>
<p>Libraries are meant to help provide the community access to books, computers and other sources of information. However, there are those who forget that libraries are a place of quiet and study. When visiting a library it is important to be courteous to other guests and have proper library etiquette.</p>
<p>Lien asks AUHS library guests to please not bring food or drink, except for bottled water. AUHS nursing students must wear their blue uniforms at all times or will be prohibited from checking out books or accessing the computers in the university library. Students are also not allowed to wear hats.</p>
<p>She asks AUHS nursing students to be respectful of the space they enter and to please return chairs, books and other items where they first found them. If a library guest takes a book from the shelf and is not exactly sure where to put it back, he or she can leave the book on the empty space of the shelf so a helpful librarian can reshelve it in its proper place. Please do not be disruptive to other guests in the library and to not have prolonged conversations. The AUHS library is “a quiet zone” and not meant for group study.</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) alumni were honored in the New Grad Celebration Luncheon at Torrance Memorial Medical Center on January 24, 2017. The luncheon was Valentine’s Day themed with pink, white and red hearts, balloons and other decorations. The guests were served with a wide variety of sandwiches, cookies, brownies, chocolates, and candies. 30-40 students were recognized at the celebration including AUHS alumni Melvin Miclat and Vanesa Dapitan. Miclat and Dapitan were both from Cohort 14 and graduated from AUHS in May 2016.Miclat and Dapitan attended the Valentine’s Day themed celebration luncheon where they each received a Certificate of Completion for graduating from Torrance Memorial Medical Center’s new grad program. Chantal Jura, AUHS Director of Affiliations and Development, went to the luncheon on behalf of AUHS to show the university’s admiration and full support.</p>
<p>There were tables at the event reserved for the associates for participating schools such as Mount St. Mary’s University and West Coast University. Jura was unaware of the seating arrangements and happened to sit next to Dapitan.</p>
<p>“It was nice for (Miclat and Dapitan) to see a representative from their alma mater to come at their graduation for their new grad program,” said Jura, “I introduced myself and (Dapitan) was really happy that I was there.”</p>
<p>Jura was proud of how far the two AUHS alumni has come in their journey to becoming registered nurses.</p>
<p>“Going through so many different steps they had to go through to get to where they are right now is admirable and also encouraging because it goes to see that they can accomplish their dreams,” said Jura.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5696"" style=""width: 284px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5696"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5696"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/torrance.newgrad.luncheon.no4_-274x300.png"" alt=""Torrance Memorial New Grad Luncheon"" width=""274"" height=""300""><p id=""caption-attachment-5696"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS alumni Vanesa Dapitan receives a Certificate of Completion from Torrance Memorial Hospital’s new grad program.</p></div>
<p>Jura explained how graduating from the new grad program was one of the final steps to becoming a “full-fledged” and “full-paid” registered nurse.Nursing students must pass their National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) board exam in order to become a registered nurse but they must also have hospital experience, according to Jura. After a nursing student has passed the NCLEX exam, they enter new grad program which is a way for hospitals to transition newly board approved students.</p>
<p>Students in a new grad program work under a preceptor at the hospital (who is a nurse) in different units of the hospital such as the burn intensive care unit (BICU), Maternity, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), etc. Miclat and Dapitan, for example, worked in the telemetry unit. (In a telemetry unit of a hospital, patients are often in critical condition and in need of constant monitoring and care.</p>
<p>Telemetry nurses review data from special equipment to track a patient’s heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and other vitals).</p>
<p>The length of each new grad program varies, some programs can be nine months long and others can be a year long. But after nursing students complete the new grad program they will be able to work as a regular RN.</p>
<p>Jura was moved by several of the presentations at the celebration luncheon, especially the touching stories where they encouraged students to continue on with nursing even if they fail. There were many words of wisdom and encouragement. She remembered how the students had an open mic session toward the end of the event.</p>
<p>“One student went to the stage and she shared how the first time she didn’t pass her NCLEX the first time. It was devastating and she was unsure of retaking it,” Jura said, “But the school was so supportive and told her to keep going.”</p>
<p>Jura strives for all of her students at AUHS to be successful like Miclat and Dapitan. Jura works with AUHS students individually, help make sure that their portfolios are ready, that they are connected on linkedin, that they have at least a clear sense of what they want to do after graduation. Her goal is to have herstudents informed about the best practices to get employed set realistic goals and to know what their options are after graduation.</p>

 Unified Worship and Prayer for a New Year,https://news.auhs.edu/unified-worship-and-prayer-for-a-new-year/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Cynthia Chambers, AUHS Financial Aid Administrator</strong></p>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) rang in the New Year by having its first Wednesday Noonday Prayer in the first week of the Winter 2017 Quarter, on January 4th. AUHS faculty and staff gathered the University Chapel to praise and worship God and to support and pray for their Christian brothers and sisters. AUHS co-workers held hands and sang “Amazing Grace” and “In His Time.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Today we’re going to be talking about unified worship and prayer for a New Year,” Chambers said.</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Bible. The attendees took turns to read each passage out loud and shared what each excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Lamentations 3:22-23</strong> <em>The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</em></p>
<p>“God’s love for you and me never ends whether we’re good today and bad tomorrow.” said AUHS Founder Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), “Whether or not we move away from God, his love is still the same; His mercy never ends.”</p>
<p>Human love is conditional and human faithfulness is to a certain extent but God’s love and mercy is everlasting. When you are comfortable and prosperous in life, you have many friends who are faithful to you. But when you are going through difficult times, (whether it’s personal, financial or otherwise), your friends, acquaintances&nbsp; and even family members will abandon you because human faithfulness is only to a certain extent.</p>
<p>“When you have a bad day, you go home and you’re frustrated but then you go to sleep, wake up the next day, you feel refreshed, you feel blessed and you know that God got you up that morning. And everything is filled with love.” Brian Cuffey said.</p>
<p>Even when you did things that you know is not right, God is still merciful. However, we felt like the other day, we wake up each morning and we feel refreshed because His mercy is still there.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 43:18-19 </strong><em>Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.</em></p>
<p>“This speaks to me that this is the New Year. Everything is a new start regardless of what happened in the past whether good or bad, said Dr. Sisi Chen, AUHS Director of Institutional Research, “I’m looking forward to the future with God’s blessings.”</p>
<p>Being that it is a New Year, It is important to always have hope and to continue moving forward. One must let go of negative thoughts and fears.</p>
<p>“God does not give us the spirit of fear. He gives us power and a sound mind. A lot of times when we are scared, it’s not of God,” said Dr. Dang, “When we panic, we lose control and we allow the world to come in to tell us what to do. Then we no longer rely upon God.”</p>
<p>There are times in life where there will be storms- death, sickness and other trials and tribulations, said Dr. Dang, but if you have peace in the middle of the storm, then that is of God. When you allow God to become your center, everything else will work itself out.</p>
<p>The storm comes to confuse, to distract and to cause worry. But it will come to pass so we can learn something from it. Evil things, evil situations, evil circumstances want to recycle itself but evil will only prevail if you allow it. Have faith in God and in yourself.</p>
<p>“When people thought AUHS would have never ever gotten through CCNE, or that we would never ever meet all four standards or that we would not have gotten that report out on time, God showed us that it was possible. He made it happen,” Dr. Dang said.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 20:4</strong> <em>May He give you the desire of the heart and make all your plans succeed.</em></p>
<p>“For me this says dig deep, think about the things that you really want; not the shiny new bauble at the home goods store. But what you really want to happen in your life,” said AUHS Provost, Dr. Scherlin, “Ask our Father for guidance and he will show you the way. He may not give it to you on a silver platter but he will show you how to get there.”</p>
<p>Getting what you want from life is a matter of going to God.</p>
<p>“If you don’t know what your actual desires are, you may think your wants and your needs are superficial but your desires are deep inside your heart,” said Chambers, “In order to have that desire fulfilled you have to go to God because he knows what he planted that in your heart. Go to Him to have Him flourish so that you can give it to Him and see it succeed.”</p>
<p>There are several times where the bible discusses desire, according to Hai Luong, Admissions. Luong referred to Psalm 37- “Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart” and Proverbs 13:12- Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but desire fulfilled is the tree of life.</p>
<p>“In any arena in life you must have strong desire. If we don’t have a desire we are not motivated to succeed in life,” said Luong, “However, we must check our desire against the word to see that if that desire is Godly, not our own lustful desire.”</p>
<p>God gives us desire in order to motivate us to work hard for his blessings.</p>
<p>“I think that he most worthwhile things that God gives to you are the things that you have to work for,” said Dr. Scherlin, “What I’ve noticed in my children and grandchildren and in other individuals is if it comes too easy then nobody appreciates it. But if you had to work for it, that is God’s gift to you. You would not have really appreciated it if you hadn’t worked hard, sacrificed and suffered to make it happen. That is God’s promise to you.”</p>

<p>Valentine’s Day is not just about expressing love to your significant other. It is also a day to show love to your friends, family, and fellow peers! Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-founder of American University of Health Sciences (AUHS), expressed love and admiration for his students, faculty, and staff by giving them beautiful red roses. Maria Maloles, the AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications, visited every classroom in the university on Pastor Johnson’s behalf and surprised each student with a rose on Tuesday morning, February 14, 2017.</p>
<p>The students smiled, giggled and whispered to one another excitedly as Maloles approached them with hugs and flowers.</p>
<p>“I hope you all have a lovely Valentine’s Day!” Maloles said to one classroom after she finished passing out the roses, “We have some balloons in the lobby if you want to take a selfie!”</p>
<p>The university created a display in the main lobby with red heart-shaped and gold letter balloons that spelled out the word, “Love.” Maloles called the spectacle, “Love is in the Air.” Students had the opportunity to take photos in front of the display throughout the day.</p>
<p>Not only did Maloles surprise students with a single red rose but also gave a bouquet of a dozen roses to AUHS faculty and staff. This thoughtf</p>
<p>ul gift helped everyone at the university reflect on the meaning of love and Valentine’s day. Dr. Christina Baker, an AUHS General Studies Professor, expressed what the holiday meant to her.</p>

<p>“My family has five birthdays in February so to me, Valentine’s Day means family,” said Mastron.</p>
<p>Mastron also had some advice for students visiting the library on Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>“If you are ever in the library, I would tell you to brush up on your cardiology!” Mastron said.</p>
<p>Maria Maloles, the AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications, surprises nursing students with roses on Tuesday, February 14, 2017.Chantal Jura, the AUHS Director of Career Services and Affiliations, shared how she thought Valentine’s Day should be celebrated throughout the year.</p>
<p>“All you need is love but a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt,” Jura said, “Valentine’s Day is a holiday for people to remember to do nice things but we should always show love and gratitude to one another every day.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Ryan will play a decisive role in shaping and implementing the vision and mission of AUHS, advocating for the AUHS’ faith core values, inspiring and supporting faculty, students, and the university community,” said Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>Dr. Ryan was given a reception with leadership, faculty and staff in the 2nd Floor Conference room from 12-1 pm, attended a meeting with AUHS’ School of Pharmacy from 1-4:15 pm before attending her interview with the AUHS Board of Trustees from 4:30-5:30 pm.</p>

 On Hope and Faith,https://news.auhs.edu/on-hope-and-faith/,,Morning Dew,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>“I have hoped for the best from God and have believed too in His love. That in everything that happens in my life, He ordains from up above, To Bless me.”</strong></p>
<p>There are times in life when people are distracted by the world and lose sight of God’s love and wisdom. People are often distracted by worldly desires and self-pity.</p>
<p>“There are times when people say, ‘Why me Lord? This isn’t fair,’” said Pastor Johnson as he looked across the room. He then asked his faculty and staff, “Do we act like or think that God doesn’t see everything?”</p>
<p>“I forget that God is watching me and God will teach me a lesson in his own way and I will know and God will give me that signal,” said AUHS Director of Institutional Research, Sisi Chen.</p>
<p>God’s plan for us is beyond human comprehension. We may not know it is a blessing until it has come to pass.</p>
<p>“No matter what I do in my life, God already knows me and He already has a plan,” said AUHS Clinical Instructor, Kristen Soegeng, “He already knows what happens next and everything I go through is a blessing from God, whether I look at it as bad or good.”</p>
<p>There are times in life that people think that they know everything or that we know more than God but these individuals are mistaken.</p>
<p>“We have this tip of the iceberg view of what’s going on and when we say, ‘Why me?’ we’re not seeing what’s under the water,” said Dianna Scherlin, Provost, “We forget that we don’t know everything.”</p>
<p>Although we can never fully understand God’s plan, it is important to have faith and believe that He wants to bless his children.</p>
<p>“I hope for the best from God,” said Hai Luong, AUHS Admission, “A lot of the times we forget that God owns the whole universe. The bible says heaven is God’s throne and the earth is his foot stool.”</p>
<p>Humans try to get the good things from this planet but the earth is only God’s foot stool. Sometimes we just ask for too little, other times we expect for too little.</p>
<p>“Jesus says you do not have because you do not ask. Ask and you will be given. This makes me hope for the best in God,” said Luong.</p>
<p><strong>Hope – </strong><em>She has taken refuge night the fireplace. Has found warmth right near your heart. She has determined to stay ‘til what was asked. Has not simply birthed, but starts.</em></p>
<p>There is hope because of God’s eternal love. Sometimes people’s hope is small and needs to be nurtured and protected like one would do for a baby.</p>
<p>“Hearth means heart. I think think this refers to how you find comfort in the hope that you have through God,” said Amarri Sanders, Student Success Coordinator, “This speaks out to me because when we’re scared and cold, we want that warmth and hope to protect us. You keep this hope near your heart like a baby and protect it.”</p>
<p>Despite the most desperate and helpless situations one may encounter in life, there is always hope because of God’s eternal love for us.</p>
<p>“Hope is always there. Sometimes it starts off really small but it manifests itself when you need it the most,” said Stephanie Lien, Librarian.</p>
<p>If there is no hope, then there is no life. Pastor Johnson told the room that his last sermon was about hope. He remembered how he saw that many of the parishioners sitting in the pews seemed to have lost hope.</p>
<p>“Once you get the point where you’ve lost all hope then you have lost everything,” said Pastor Johnson, “There are people walking around who are like the living dead because they have lost all hope.”</p>
<p>There are people that we, as fellow Christians will come into contact with whose eyes are open but their eyes are shut because they have lost hope in themselves and in God.</p>
<p>“It’s up to us as sons and daughters of the most high God to waken hope inside of them, to stir them up again, to rise up on their behalf to fight for them, to wield shield and buckler and spear and arrow so that we can slay whatever has</p>
<p>made them fall asleep and whatever that has taken their hope,” said Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>Faith –</strong> <em>I have faith in God’s promises. You see, I know His word is true. So no matter what I’m confronted with, the Lord will bring me through.</em></p>
<p>“Faith is everything as Christians. Faith is the motivation to keep going. Faith is the fire that burns within you that keeps you going, the determination,” said Sanders, “Faith is important when it comes to believing God’s promises, and believing the word that he speaks and that we read. I think that’s a core value in what we do in life, why we live and breathe.”</p>
<p>Not only is faith is essential in walking on the path of salvation but your intentions as well.</p>
<p>“It’s really important for anybody to have good intentions. Once you have good intentions and you decide to do a task then God will be with you,” said Aya Almukhtar, Admissions, “God promised that he will be with everybody regardless of your dreams or desires and He will help you through it.”</p>
<p>Almuhktar also discussed how trials and tribulations can be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>“Sometimes bad things happen to us because when we wish for something, we are attached to negative things and we don’t know it,” said Almukhtar, “ In order for us to reach our destination, we have to let go of these negative things. God will take the negative people, events and things from us to lead us where we want to be.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson offered his insight as to how God did not want to take things away but to give us more. God only wants to bless His children and we must have faith in His intentions.</p>
<p>“Sometimes God allows bad things to happen so He can bless us. We want to hold on to nickels and God wants to give us a dollar. We want to hold onto a dollar and God wants to give us a hundred. We want to hold onto small things, and our God is a great God. The gold and the silver are His,” said Pastor Johnson, “We’re sons and daughters of the most high God so our faith is in God’s faithfulness in His love for us.”</p>

 Winter 2017 U2 Meeting,https://news.auhs.edu/kesalahan-dalam-main-main-dominoqq/,,Event Summaries,"<div class=""mceTemp""></div>

<p>Nursing students filled every seat in the second floor conference room for the “University Update” meeting or U2 on Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at American University of Health Sciences (AUHS). U2 is an event that takes place on the third or fourth week of each quarter. In this meeting, AUHS students are briefed on essential information regarding their education, new faculty, upcoming events, and more.</p>
<p>The U2 meeting began with a presentation from AUHS Interim President, Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.). Dr. Dang commended the students on their outstanding performance on the NCLEX Board Exam. AUHS nursing students achieved a BRN pass rate of 91.94% for the years 2015-2016.</p>
<p>“We don’t look at our students in terms of numbers and that only 3.8 GPA students are capable,” said Dr. Dang, “We have proven that even if you don’t have a 3.8 entering GPA, you can still beat the UC system in pass rates.”</p>
<p>Most nursing programs in UC and Cal State universities require a 3.8-4.0 GPA in order to be considered for admission. AUHS only requires the minimum GPA of 2.5. This exceptional pass rate was achieved by the “efforts, commitment and dedication of AUHS students, faculty and administration,” according to Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>This high pass rate is significant because most employers in the nursing field look at an applicant’s NCLEX Board Exam score.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang discussed the <a href=""http://www.aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation"">Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education</a> (CCNE), a national accreditation agency that assesses Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctorate nursing programs for public and private schools. CCNE allows students and consumers to know whether or not a school has met a higher standard than what is required from the state level. (The minimum requirement for a Nursing program is to receive accreditation from the <a href=""http://www.rn.ca.gov/"">Board of Registered Nursing</a> or “BRN”). AUHS’ CCNE accreditation has to be renewed every 5 years.</p>
<p>“We have met all four standards with flying colors for CCNE,” said Dr. Dang, “CCNE will have a hearing sometime in April 2017 for our reaffirmation.”</p>
<p>The University was also visited by the <a href=""http://www.acics.org/"">Accrediting Council For Independent Colleges and Schools</a> (ACICS) from October 6-7, 2016.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5631"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5631"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5631"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170124_132650-300x164.jpg"" alt=""AUHS students gather at the quarterly U2 meeting on January 24, 2017."" width=""300"" height=""164""><p id=""caption-attachment-5631"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS students gather at the quarterly U2 meeting on January 24, 2017.</p></div>
<p>“We did not have any problems with ACICS ;except they wanted us to have a more in-depth assessment of our Admissions Department’s quality assurance,” said Dr. Dang, “We have to devise a plan to ensure our Admissions Department is telling you accurate information and that they don’t make decisions in terms of accepting you as students, which they don’t. But we have to prove to them that we have a process.”</p>
<p>AUHS had also applied for <a href=""http://www.acswasc.org/"">Western Association of Schools and Colleges</a> (WASC) in 2013 to allow AUHS students the “ease of transferability,” said Dr. Dang. WASC will perform a site visit at AUHS from April 25-27, 2017.</p>
<p>Dr. Dang announced that the University’s Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) would be visiting the University on January 25-26, 2017 to ensure AUHS has met all the standards.</p>
<p>AUHS must submit an annual report to the BRN, however, BRN accreditation only lasts five years and the University’s expires in August 2017.</p>
<p>“This is our third time being reaccredited and this is just a routine visit,” said Dr. Dang, “The nursing board visit is to make sure that the reaccreditation process is doing what it’s supposed to do. It allows us to see what we have done correctly and what we can do to improve.”</p>
<p>Although the BRN site visit is nothing out of the ordinary, the BRN reaccreditation is a necessity because it allows AUHS students to take the NCLEX Board Exam.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.tracs.org/"">Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools</a> (TRACS) is a “non-profit, self-governing organization (that) promotes the welfare [. . .] and development of postsecondary institutions whose mission is characterized by a distinctly Christian purpose” is scheduled to visit AUHS in June 2017.</p>
<p>The reason for these accreditation visits is to prepare the university in its goal to create several new programs. AUHS plans to give the opportunity for students to pursue Nurse Practitioner (NP), Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP), Master of Science in Nursing (MDN), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), Master of Business Administration (or “MBA,” that only focuses on healthcare management), and Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degrees.</p>
<p>AUHS Provost Dr. Dianna Scherlin’s presentation in the U2 meeting emphasized the importance of student involvement in the accreditation process.</p>
<p>“There has to be student involvement in this activity,” said AUHS Provost Dr. Dianna Scherlin, “I’m asking every Cohort to join our advisory board task force for the WASC, TRACS and other accreditation teams.”</p>
<p>One of the assignments students will be given is to read some sections of the report and give their honest opinion so they will have a voice in the accreditation process. Members of the advisory board will have the opportunity to be the representative students when WASC visits the University.</p>
<p>Dr. Scherlin encouraged students who are interested in joining the student advisory board to visit her office for more information. Students who participate in this advisory board will receive a certificate, a letter of recommendation and a party. Dr. Scherlin is also seeking authorization to give participating students community service hours.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5632"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5632"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5632"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170124_142501-300x241.jpg"" alt=""AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications Maria Maloles updating AUHS students on their community service hours."" width=""300"" height=""241""><p id=""caption-attachment-5632"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications Maria Maloles updating AUHS students on their community service hours.</p></div>
<p>AUHS students were also updated on their community service hours by AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications Maria Maloles. Students are required to complete 100 hours of community service in order to graduate, said Maloles. Students will now have the opportunity to schedule their volunteer hours ahead of time because AUHS had posted a calendar of community outreach events and volunteer opportunities for 2017 on the University’s Moodle account. Each community service event will also have a list of people that are needed at the particular event.</p>
<p>“The first (event) is the Blood Drive on February 27th,” said Maloles, “Please come to my office at Room 310 if you want to sign up.”</p>
<p>Maloles also clarified how many community service hours students would receive for each task and event. If a student volunteers at an event during the weekend, he or she will receive three community service hours for every hour they volunteer at that event. If a student volunteers at an event during the weekday, they will get two community service hours for every hour they volunteer. If a student does filing, typing and other clerical work during the weekday, they will receive one hour for every hour they volunteer.</p>
<p>AUHS will be branching out to Building 2 and 3 on campus. All of AUHS Administration (i.e. Financial Aid, Student Services, Career Services, etc.) will be moved from the third floor of Building 1 to Building 2 before the WASC site visit in April 2017.</p>
<p>The third floor in Building 1 will be converted into larger classrooms for the Nursing program. Building 3 will be designated for the PharmD program.</p>
<p>Some AUHS nursing students have been hired even though they have not graduated yet. Hospitals are trying to employ some students ahead of time, according to Dr. Dang.</p>
<p>“The reason why a lot of hospitals love our students is because of their sincerity and their genuine interest in helping patients and that’s not the norm. AUHS students actually care,” Dr. Dang said.</p>
<p>AUHS is a University that cares for its students and wishes to help them succeed and reach their highest potential.</p>
<p>“If you have questions or concerns, it doesn’t help to talk just to a friend because they can’t do anything for you because they are not part of administration,” said Dr. Dang, “If you need help, speak to (the Dean of Nursing) Dr. Mercy Popoola, (the Provost) Dr. Dianna Scherlin, (Vice President, Operations and Development) Dr. Marilyn Uvero, (Director of Student Affairs) Ivy Javaluyas, or me. We are here for you.”</p>
<p>“I love coming to graduation at the Long Beach Convention Center and seeing how happy our student’s families are and that’s why a lot of us in the AUHS Administration are doing this,” said Dr. Dang, “I really love what we do here and I want to make sure that we continue to give students the same opportunities.”</p>
<p>AUHS is a private, for-profit, minority owned, minority serving, Christian-based university whose mission is to educate and equip students with life careers and to produce quality health care professionals for the community, the nation and the world. It is a university where appreciation of life and one’s spiritual reason for existence can be nurtured.</p>

 AUHS to Collaborate with the MHALA,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-collaborate-mhala/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp"">

Pilon."" width=""300"" height=""225""><p id=""caption-attachment-5627"" class=""wp-caption-text"">MHALA President and CEO, Dr. David A. Pilon.</p></div>
<p>Mental Health America of Los Angeles (MHALA) visited American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) to discuss the fruitful possibilities of collaboration on Monday, January 30, 2017. MHALA President and CEO, Dr. David A. Pilon and MHALA Vice President Kathleen McDermott met with AUHS Co-founder Pastor Gregory Johnson and his staff in the second floor conference room. MHA Village is a homeless and mental health assistance program that provides services to those in need.The meeting began with an opening prayer from AUHS Co-founder, Pastor Gregory Johnson. Pastor Johnson thanked God for all the years that the MHA Village has served and worked with “populations that are so routinely set aside and so routinely invisible to man people.”</p>
<p>In the beginning of his presentation, Pastor Johnson mentioned how he had known Dr. Pilon for many years.</p>
<p>“(Dr. Pilon) and I hit it off. What I admired so much about him is that he is not pretentious, he is accessible and he is a person that cares about what’s happening in the community of mental health,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson explained the mission statement of AUHS to his guests. It was the University’s goal to educate and equip students in life careers in the health field- nursing, research and pharmacy, and to produce quality health care professionals as well as create a place where an appreciation of life and one’s spiritual reason for existence can be nurtured.</p>
<p>He believed that AUHS nursing students would be perfect candidates to volunteer for MHALA because both organizations shared many of the same core values. Just like MHALA, AUHS strives to serve and uplift people who are homeless and mentally ill. It is AUHS’ mission for its students to not only strive for academic excellence, but to teach its future nurses the importance of truly caring for and understanding the most vulnerable people in society.</p>
<p>“Our vision is to use the field of health care as a means for addressing social, economic and health care disparity, in medically underserved populations and areas both locally and globally,” said Pastor Johnson said, “We look at health care reform as a way of crossing over or removing that disparity but we strongly believe it has to start in populations that are traditionally not involved in the solution part of health care, such as disenfranchised families.”</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5626"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_5610-300x250.jpg"" alt=""MHALA Building"" width=""300"" height=""250"">Pastor Johnson discussed the many charitable events the University holds every year including “Health Fair,” “Santa Cause,” “Acts of Love,” and “Giving Thanks,” where AUHS gives free groceries, money and health care services to needy families and individuals. Pastor Johnson also discussed “Lamp Unto My Feet,” a community outreach project that was recommended by an AUHS student.</p>
<p>“Lamp Unto My Feet” is an event where AUHS partners with homeless shelters such as Long Beach Rescue Mission and students washed the feet of homeless men and women.</p>
<p>“It goes back to Jesus washing the feet of the disciples. But it also lets the recipient know that they are valued, they have someone to talk (and) they have someone who is present with them,” said Pastor Johnson, “There is a great deal of mental health issues in the homeless community. And just being in a place where someone&nbsp; doesn’t look down to them but actually bows to them resonates fully in a lot of things that they would want to do.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson told Dr. Pilon that he and AUHS wanted to help MHALA because they, as a University, wanted to help their community more. Pastor Johnson shared how he had been homeless for two years after his mother and little brother died.</p>
<p>“Your personal experience is what a lot of our members experience,” Dr. Pilon said.</p>
<p>Dr. Pilon was “impressed” with Pastor Johnson’s presentation and appreciated the University’s focus on serving “the most vulnerable among us.” MHALA is an agency that ostensively focuses on people with severe and persistent mental illnesses, Dr. Pilon said,&nbsp; but what they have come to understand is the fact that “even though their mental illnesses oftentimes is the cause or the source of the issue, the problem extends way beyond just the behavioral health condition.”</p>
<p>“It is much more about poverty and isolation and loss of hope,” Dr. Pilon said, “So our job is to help people recover and find a platform that helps people find a way back into society from which they’re been exiled.”</p>
<p>Dr. Pilon went on to say that he was very proud of the “welcoming” culture that MHA had and how they were a training site for a tremendous number of social work, nursing and nurse practitioner students. Although MHALA’s need for volunteers is “maxed out to some extent, I’m not closing the door on this,” said Dr. Pilon, “We can try to work with you and try to figure out if we have room for this (collaboration).”</p>
<p>The collaboration between AUHS and MHALA is in its early stages but it is likely AUHS students will have opportunities to volunteer with MHALA either in psych rotations or in special projects.</p>

 Blood Donation Guidelines,https://news.auhs.edu/blood-donation-guidelines/,,University News,"<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5613"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hemoglobinironflyer-210x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""210"" height=""300""><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5614"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/power.red_.flyer_-200x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""300"">Your blood can help save a life. American University of Health Sciences (AUHS), in collaboration with American Red Cross (ARC), will be holding a blood drive on Monday, February 27, 2017 from 10 am- 4 pm on the AUHS university campus. Donors will also receive a $5 Amazon gift card via email after their donation! Ask an American Red Cross staff member at the event for further instructions.</p>
<p>Here are some things you should know to maximize your blood donation and help more patients. <em>(The following information had been obtained from the American Red Cross medical/health care flyers.)</em></p>
<h2><strong>Power Red Donation</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who should donate?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Donors with blood types O negative, O positive, A negative, and B negative are encouraged to give a Power Red Donation.</li>
<li>Donors who are A or B positive are encouraged to give a whole blood donation, as plasma is needed from these blood types.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>What is a Power Red Donation?</strong>
<ol>
<li>During a Power Red donation, you give a concentrated dose of red blood cells, the part of your blood used for those who need blood transfusions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>How does the Power Red donation work?</strong>
<ol>
<li>This type of donation uses an automated process that separates your red blood cells from the rest of your other blood components, then safely and comfortably returns your plasma and platelets to you.</li>
<li>Many blood donors say that the Power Red donation is a more comfortable experience because it requires a smaller needle and fluids are returned to the donor during the donation process.</li>
<li>Power red donors can give every 112 days which is different that a regular blood donation every 56 days.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>What are red blood cells?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Red blood cells are the most commonly transfused blood component and the most needed.</li>
<li>Since they carry oxygen throughout the body, they are essential.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Who needs my red blood cells?</strong>
<ol>
<li>These red cells help trauma and surgery patients, those undergoing organ transplants, women experiencing complications from childbirth, and people with anemia.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the requirements for a Power Red donation?</strong>
<ol>
<li>In addition to meeting standard blood donor qualifications, the following requirements apply for those interested in Power Red donation:</li>

Hemoglobin and Iron</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is hemoglobin?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Hemoglobin is a protein carried by the red blood cells that contains iron.</li>
<li>A blood donor must have a hemoglobin level of at least 12.5 gm/dl.</li>
<li>If you’re hemoglobin is too low, you may not be able to donate blood that day. This does not necessarily mean you are unhealthy; you just don’t have a high enough hemoglobin level to share your red cells that day.</li>
<li>A low hemoglobin level could be caused by a diet low in iron-rich foods, blood loss, pregnancy or another medical condition.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>What is iron?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Iron is necessary in building the proteins of red blood cells and is required for producing energy from food.</li>
<li>Iron is an important factor in every activity your body performs.</li>
<li>Iron in the hemoglobin molecule also helps carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs for removal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>How can I boost my iron level?</strong>
<ol>
<li>You can improve your iron level and your hemoglobin by changing your diet by including more high- iron foods and by avoiding substances that reduce iron absorption.</li>
<li>There are two types of iron: heme iron and non-heme iron.
<ol>
<li>Heme iron, which is found in meat, fish and poultry, is more easily absorbed than the non-heme iron.</li>
<li>Non-heme iron is found primarily in fruits vegetables, dried beans, nuts and grain products.</li>
<li>When you eat the two together, the non-heme iron is more easily absorbed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Iron Boosters (high-iron foods)
<ol>
<li>Ready-to-eat cereals</li>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Spinach</li>
<li>Beef</li>
<li>Shrimp</li>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Oysters</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Peas</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Watermelon</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Iron Busters
<ol>
<li>Iron Busters are foods that reduce the absorption of iron by your body. Avoiding iron-busters is important in boosting your iron level.</li>
<li>Iron Busters include:
<ol>
<li>Caffeinated beverages</li>
<li>Chocolate</li>
<li>An excess of high-fiber foods</li>
<li>Some medications like antacids or phosphate salts</li>

<p><strong>By Seung Yong Lee</strong></p>
<p>“Pray it Forward” was different from the other volunteering opportunities American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) had offered previously. When I participated in community outreach events such as Health Fair, the students and I stayed in the university parking lot and the people who needed free groceries and other services would come to us. However this time, the students went to the people of the community.</p>
<p>My peers and I were given $40-60 worth of five-dollar bills to give to the homeless. We walked and drove to many different places in the community, looking for people in need of help. One of the places we visited was Downtown Long Beach, an area that we knew several homeless people resided. As we walked around we encountered countless individuals who were homeless and who were trying to survive the harsh winter with only tarps and blankets.</p>
<p>The first homeless man I came across was a 70-year-old U.S. Army Veteran who wished to remain anonymous. He told me that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and he eventually got addicted to street drugs trying to cope with his pain. I asked him if he received any therapy or treatment for his addiction problem. He said, “Yes,” but in the end, the therapy did not help him to quit. He was never married and he had no family. He was alone. It made me feel blessed and honored to speak and pray with this veteran who sacrificed everything for this country.</p>

<p>We handed $5 to every homeless person we came across. They thanked us and we felt blessed to be able to help them. After handing out the money, we prayed together and asked God for a better life. After two hours of walking around the neighborhoods, my peers and I met over 50 people.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I was afraid to approach the homeless, because I had preconceived notions that they were dangerous and they were nothing but addicts and troublemakers. “Pray it Forward”</p>
<p>helped me open my eyes. People who are homeless are human beings who are in difficult situations in life. They have different hopes and dreams and they all have a story to tell. ven though they are struggling, they are doing the best they could to make it another day. Every homeless person I met that day was kind, despite their current situation. We should all strive to understand one another and to give to those who need it the most.</p>

 The Bigger Picture – Pray it Forward 2017,https://news.auhs.edu/pray-forward-bigger-picture/,,Event Summaries,"<div id=""attachment_5603"" style=""width: 235px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5603"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5603"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_1093-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""225"" height=""300""><p id=""caption-attachment-5603"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS nursing student Cindy Truong gives $5 to a homeless man at Bixby Park in Long Beach, Ca for the annual “Pray it Forward” charity event.</p></div>
<p><strong>By Mohini Patel</strong></p>
<p>When we are overwhelmed by school and work, we often do not see the bigger picture. At first, we may not realize when we are learning something invaluable that can bless people everyday in so many ways.&nbsp; We tend to dwell in our own selfishness instead of becoming active members of the community that sincerely and unconditionally gives to those in need.</p>
<p>My fellow nursing students and I had the opportunity to participate in “Pray It Forward,” an annual charity event held by American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) last December. I previously heard of this event before and was vaguely told by a fellow classmate that “it’s just passing out money to the poor.”&nbsp; However, as the day went on, I discovered that this community outreach event was much more complex and spiritually rewarding than what I had expected.</p>
<p>“Pray it Forward,” began in the afternoon, on our AUHS campus. The students and I were each given a stack of flyers and $60 worth of five-dollar bills from Pastor Gregory Johnson, the Co-Founder of AUHS. Our task was to give $5 to every individual in need with a prayer and a blessing.</p>
<p>The university wanted us to stay in the local area (Signal Hill and Long Beach) so my peers and I decided it would be a more efficient use of our time to split into smaller groups and drive to places where we knew people in need congregated. I approached some people who were asleep on the sidewalk or on a bench. They woke up startled and confused but soon smiled when they realized our good intentions.&nbsp; Although the individuals who lived in these parks and on the streets of Long Beach were generally not accepted in our society, they were very accepting of me. In return, these individuals gave me a prayer and a blessing.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5608"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5608"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5608"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mohini.Patel_-300x225.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225""><p id=""caption-attachment-5608"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS nursing student Mohini Patel shares her blessings to needy individuals in the community by giving them money and a heartfelt prayer.</p></div>
<p>I noticed that most of the homeless people I spoke to that day traveled in groups.&nbsp; They ate, slept and walked with their friends who were also poor and homeless. It was touching to see that after we gave one homeless person money and a blessing, he or she would say, “Don’t forget about [so-and-so]. He’s just asleep over there.”</p>
<p>This experience humbled me and made me see how we cannot be selfish with the blessings we have.&nbsp; Even the poorest and the most downtrodden people did not want to keep the money and good news to themselves. Instead, they passed along the blessing. This is a lesson that I will never forget. Instead of being selfish with my blessings and only thinking about my needs, I have to do what I can to share my gifts with those who need it the most.</p>
<p>As a nursing student, this event helped me better understand my community and helped me realize that there are many of those who need God’s help; even in our own backyard. I feel more connected to the city and have a better understanding of the difficult issues many homeless individuals face. I will take the lessons I learned from “Pray it Forward” with me and I will continue to help and pray for the sick and the needy even after graduation.</p>

 Reflection and Renewal,https://news.auhs.edu/reflection-and-renewal/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p><strong>Led by Stephanie Lien, AUHS Librarian</strong></p>
<p>“After Thanksgiving I feel like everything goes by pretty fast. We’re heading straight to the end of the year and I’ve been thinking about beginnings and ends,” said Lien, “This whole school year has been a continuing cycle of changes so I’ve decided to pick quotes from the Bible that reflect on renewal,” said Lien.</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle, read the following passages out loud and shared what the excerpts meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>2 Corinthians 5:17 </strong><em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.</em></p>
<p>“Every single one of us was created by God therefore we begin and we end by God,” said Dr. Sisi Chen, Director of Institutional Research and Assessment.</p>
<p>The biggest change that every human being must go through is death. But God is with us in every step of the way, including the final stages in our lives. We should not fear death because it is not the end, it is only the beginning. When the day comes for us to pass away, we will “go back to God, our Father,” said Chen.</p>
<p>Chen also emphasized how essential our relationship with God is in everything we do in life.</p>
<p>“When we are close to God, no matter what we have experienced, tomorrow will always be a new day,” Chen said.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ came into this world to reconcile humanity with God. Not only should our spirits be open to God’s love, but our hearts and minds as well.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you have to let old stuff out of your heart and out of your mind in order to make space to learn new information that could help you,” said Brian Cuffey, AUHS Maintenance man, “I think that’s pretty much what God is saying to us. Get rid of some of that old stuff that’s inside you. Let God in your heart and let Him guide you.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Proverbs 20:21</strong> <em>An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginning will not be blessed in the end.</em></p>
<p>In a world of instant gratification, many of us tend to forget the virtue of patience and hard work. The pressures, trials and tribulations that we experience in life allows us to have the capacity to appreciate what we have and to keep what we earn.</p>
<p>“If we did not put any effort into getting our job position, money or other material things, what we acquire cannot be deep and it cannot be rooted down. So all of these things become very shallow,” said Dr. Kim Dang (Hon.), AUHS Founder, “When the wind comes, you will get blown over and in the end, you will have nothing because you didn’t learn any life lessons.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dang congratulated everyone at the prayer meeting for helping the school achieve its CCNE accreditation.</p>
<p>“All of us worked so hard for the CCNE accreditation. When we got it, it felt great because we earned it; it wasn’t handed to us.” Dr. Dang said, “This school is 23 going on 24-years-old and our success didn’t come overnight. Because we work from the bottom up, we know that we create opportunities for people who wouldn’t get normally get many opportunities otherwise.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Revelation 21:4</strong> <em>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, no crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</em></p>
<p>As the year 2016 draws to a close, it is important for us to reflect on the past in order to grow from our mistakes but to always move forward in the direction of Christ. There is always hope of a better tomorrow because of God.</p>
<p>“When Christ was crucified he said, ‘It is finished.’ But for us, it is not finished when the bell rings for 2017. It will be a new beginning for us and there’s a lot of work left to be done,” said Dr. Mercy Popoola, Dean of School of Nursing .</p>
<p>We are able to “enter into God’s rest” because Christ’s death “finished everything,” said Pastor Gregory Johnson, AUHS Co-founder.</p>
<p>“The problem that we have sometimes is that we don’t realize that it’s finished, that we’ve already won, that we’ve already had a victory. Anyone that passes through this world and goes into the next, (will be) with Jesus. But we don’t always see it that way,” Pastor Johnson said, “The world wants us to believe that it’s not done when it actually is done. All of us already have the victory, all of us already have the healing, all of us already have the prosperity. All we need to do now is accept God.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ephesians 4:22-24</strong> <em>To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.</em></p>
<p>It is never too late to change for the better because God forgives all who seek Him. You don’t have to wait until the end or the beginning of the year to turn over a new leaf.</p>
<p>“Many of us have done things in the past that were not of God. They were probably things that you regret doing by making mistakes, sinning or just being human,” said Cynthia Chambers, Financial Aid Adviser, “But once you get through those times and you acknowledge that Christ is your saviour, you can become a new person, a new spirit and a new mind. You don’t have to hold onto the things that you’ve done wrong.”</p>
<p>People have the ability to change and grow everyday. All it takes is self-reflection and empathy.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you say things as a joke but then you realize your words really did hurt someone. Be the bigger person, go to them and see their point of view,” said Dr. Marilyn Uvero, Vice President of Operations and Development, “Little changes can be significant at the end of the day as you move forward in how you deal with people and in making sure that you treat them as kind as you want them to be treated.”</p>
<p>Growth does not come from things that are often kind, pleasing or delightful. Growth comes from the things that are sometimes grating, caustic and difficult.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson referred to 2 Corinthians 12:8 where Paul asked God to remove the thorn from his side and God said, “My grace is sufficient.”</p>
<p>“God is saying, ‘I don’t want to remove the thorn, I want you to grow from the thorn, I want you to become better because of the thorn,’” Pastor Johnson said, “Our tendency is to avoid thorns, to remove it as quickly as possible. But sometimes it’s that thing that makes you pay attention.”</p>
<p>If you get a thorn in your foot, you pay attention to your foot. If the thorn is not there, you don’t pay attention to your feet and you don’t you pay attention to where you walk.</p>
<p>“Our grace is that God will allow even our thorns to help us grow in the moment and to look at it as something positive so we can become better people,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Thorns can come in many forms, including required college courses.</p>
<p>“(Students) can skip and drop classes because they don’t like their final grades. But it doesn’t mean they won’t have to take the class again,” Pastor Johnson said, “You can drop, disengage and quit as much as you want. You can close off the door and close off the communication, but if it’s a required class by God, you will take that class again in order to graduate.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:8</strong> <em>The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.</em></p>
<p>Patience is a virtue. All things in life, whether it’s work, school or relationships, requires kindness, tolerance and self-restraint.</p>
<p>“A lot of times we push ourselves to be the best, to achieve this and achieve that,” Cuffey said, “We try to do it so fast. We try to get it done as quick as we possibly can because we try to move onto the next thing. Sometimes God is saying slow down, have some patience.”</p>
<p>Everything that happens in our life has a reason but we may not know what that reason is until our task is finished.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we like to drag our feet on certain things that we don’t like to do in the beginning,” said Dr. Dang, “A lot of us at AUHS are asked to do tasks that we might not even like and a lot of times we aren’t even told why we’re doing these things. But there’s a plan and when we finish it we realize why. The end result is getting grants, making the students happy and allowing our students to get into grad school.”</p>

 AUHS Socks It to the Cold,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-socks-cold/,,University News,"<p><strong>Galatians 6:2 </strong><em>Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</em></p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) collected over 2,000 pairs of socks to donate to the homeless this winter. AUHS Co-founder, Pastor Gregory Johnson and AUHS staff members arrived in the Mental Health America (MHA) Village, a homeless assistance program in Long Beach, with a van filled with bags of new socks on Thursday, December 15th, 2016.</p>
<p>The annual sock drive was coordinated by AUHS Director of Marketing and Publications, Maria Maloles.</p>
<p>“I am always looking forward to do this project. Socks are one of the most important things that the homeless need and yet rarely get,” Maloles said, “A lot of people assume that socks are just for winter, but it’s not.&nbsp; They need them all year round. I would continue on and collect and donate as much as I can.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson and his personnel received a warm greeting from the MHA Village’s staff members including Personal Service Coordinator, Alvaro Gomez and Program Coordinator, Marjorie Solorzano. After Pastor Johnson and his staff helped carry the socks inside the building, they were given a tour of the facilities.</p>

<p>“We are the first point of contact for everybody that comes through. We serve as a funnel,” Solorzano said, “We do a lot of linkage and get people enrolled into whatever program they might qualify for.”</p>
<p>The MHA Village provides many housing assistance, mental and physical health care services to the homeless, whom Solorzano referred to as their “clients.” Their staff included a team of social workers, a licensed psychiatric technician (LPT) and a prescriber.</p>
<p>The facilities was equipped with showers, clothes, personal lockers, and a laundry room for their clients. The MHA Village had an “Education Project” room where their clients had access to computers, giving them the opportunity to sign up for an email account, register for an identification card and more. The building even served as a mailing address for many of their homeless members.</p>
<p>The MHA Village offers internships for students from various Cal State, tech and community colleges. They have had over 500 interns in the last year, according to Solorzano. During the tour, Pastor Johnson and Jura expressed their interest in having AUHS’ nursing and pharmacy students volunteer at the MHA Village.</p>

<p>“We’re different than most other schools because we are a Christian-based, minority-serving university,” AUHS Director of Affiliations and Development, Chantal Jura said.</p>
<p>Jura then discussed the various charitable events AUHS offered to the community such as <a href=""/2016/12/02/auhs-acts-love-2016/"">Acts of Love</a> and <a href=""/2016/12/03/auhs-gives-early-thanksgiving-meal-homeless/"">Giving Thanks</a>, where students help provide needy families and individuals with free meals and health care services.</p>
<p>“We are constantly trying to teach our future nurses that it’s not just about the money,” Jura said, “We teach them to use the skills that they learn to give back to the community and make a difference.”</p>
<p>AUHS thanks the MHA Village for their hospitality and commends them for their efforts to help those who are the most vulnerable in our society. We hope to collaborate with the MHA Village in the near future. AUHS also wants to thank everyone who has donated socks this year. This sock drive would not have been possible without your support and generosity.</p>

 An Open Letter to Guillermo del Toro by Pastor Johnson,https://news.auhs.edu/open-letter-guillermo-del-toro/,,University News,"<div id=""attachment_5540"" style=""width: 176px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5540"" loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5540 size-medium"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pacific-rim-1-166x300.jpg"" alt=""Pacific Rim action figure signed by Guillermo del Toro."" width=""166"" height=""300""><p id=""caption-attachment-5540"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Pacific Rim action figure signed by Guillermo del Toro.</p></div>
<p>Exceptional individuals often appear as ordinary people. They go about their daily lives- going to school or work, shopping and spending time with family and loved ones. Some even take the time to help or say a kind, “Hello” to strangers.</p>
<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p>It was an ordinary day. I took my sons, Gregory and Temujin, and Temujin’s friend, Aaron, to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles last Sunday, January 8th, 2017. The four of us walked up and down the busy streets, enjoying the day.</p>
<p>We first visited The Japanese Museum and learned about the past injustices to those of Japanese heritage during World War II. Even then I was mindful of the painful parallels between WWII and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade where anywhere from 12 to 15 million Africans were shipped to “The New World” (including North and South America) in the 15th-19th centuries. I was attentive of the atrocities African slaves had experienced and the absence of any real reciprocity to date. They never did get their two acres and a mule.</p>
<p>Just before going to dinner, we visited my friends in Tetsu store at “Anime Jungle,” an “entertainment hobby shop” where I bought Temujin and Aaron a thing or two. Just before leaving the shop, we ran into what appeared to be an ordinary fellow.</p>
<p>The man was with his wife and daughter, browsing and buying things for himself and perhaps his child. Yet he took the time to take a picture with one of the staff persons while Tommy, the store supervisor, was helping him purchase some other items.</p>
<p>Before long, I came to realize that this was no ordinary man but prolific writer and director, Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro is a Spanish film director, screenwriter, producer, and novelist who is known for gothic horror and fantasy films such as <em>The Devil’s Backbone (2001)</em>, <em>Pan’s Labyrinth (2006)</em>, <em>Blade II (2002)</em>, <em>Hellboy (2004)</em>, the hit science fiction movie <em>Pacific Rim (2013), </em>and many other projects.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5541"" style=""width: 169px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5541"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5541"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pacific-rim-2-159x300.jpg"" alt=""Pacific Rim action figure signed by Guillermo del Toro."" width=""159"" height=""300""><p id=""caption-attachment-5541"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Pacific Rim action figure signed by Guillermo del Toro.</p></div>
<p>I asked Del Toro to autograph a <em>Pacific Rim</em> action figure and he kindly obliged like any good, ordinary person might do. He then drew a cartoon sketch of himself on a piece of paper and signed it for me.</p>
<p>I hugged Del Toro, his wife Lorenza and daughter then we bid each other goodbye. Despite his wealth and fame, Del Toro presented himself as a humble, down to earth man who loved his family and treated strangers with kindness.</p>
<p>There is something wondrous about extra-ordinary people of God. They believe, they learn, they create, and they succeed. They care and they share and they give.&nbsp; This seemingly ordinary man was not ordinary at all because he loved his family and in that I saw his love of God. He, in part, demonstrates that care in the quality of his projects. He shares that continuous gift to movie going audiences around the world.</p>
<p>I marvel at how God orchestrates for the most exceptional people to appear as ordinary individuals so that being one of God’s people, they can show their love for life.</p>
<p>Thank you Guillermo for being one of God’s extra-ordinary people and for being so incredibly exceptional in the most ordinary way; by saying, “Hello.”</p>
<p>May God Bless You, Your Wife And Family With Health And Prosperity!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson</p>

<p><strong>John 15:13 </strong><em>Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.</em></p>
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson, co-founder of American University of Health Sciences (AUHS), thanked Signal Hill Chief of Police Michael Langston for his years of service to the community and wished him a happy and healthy retirement. Pastor Johnson showed his complete support and admiration for the chief by attending Langston’s retirement party at the Petroleum Club Saturday, December 10th, 2016.</p>
<p>AUHS also congratulated the new Signal Hill Police Chief, Chris Nunley, for being appointed by the City Council last month. Nunley’s promotion is well deserved and we know that he will continue Chief Langston’s legacy of building and maintaining meaningful relationships between the SHPD, AUHS and the Signal Hill community.</p>
<p>“A lot of times police chiefs must take on a persona like they’re more than human,” said Pastor Johnson, “Michael Langston, however, knows how to be the chief and carry that role, but he’s also someone who knows how to encourage, knows how to care and knows how to give in times of great need in order to support his community. He’s a man that actually cares about what’s happening in his city.”</p>
<p>Because of Chief Langston, the Signal Hill Police Department (SHPD) and AUHS have established a healthy and lasting relationship throughout the years. Chief Langston and the SHPD has supported AUHS, especially during the university’s major events such as Acts of Love and the Health and Wellness Fair, where the university gives needy families and individuals free groceries and health care services.</p>
<p>“(Langston) is just a down to earth, non-pretentious guy. That’s why people love him so much,” Pastor Johnson said, “Anytime (AUHS) called him to be there, he’s been there without hesitation. He’s always riding around to make sure that we’re okay, especially on those occasions and events, because he knows what we’re doing.”</p>
<div id=""attachment_5527"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5527"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5527"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161210_111925-300x170.jpg"" alt=""People conversing and waiting for Chief of Police Michael Langston's retirement party to begin."" width=""300"" height=""170""><p id=""caption-attachment-5527"" class=""wp-caption-text"">People conversing and waiting for Chief of Police Michael Langston’s retirement party to begin.</p></div>
<p>The Signal Hill Police Department has also set up booths at a few of AUHS’ events. AUHS has provided the SHPD access to its building for training purposes. The SHPD mainly used AUHS’ facilities to practice how to enter and secure a building.</p>
<p>Several hundred people gathered at Langston’s retirement party including Langston’s friends, family and loved ones, his fellow police officers, local business owners and many high ranking city officials.</p>
<p>Jackie Lacey, the District Attorney of Los Angeles County, attended the event to congratulate Langston on his retirement and to commend him for his services.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chief Langston, the SHPD became the first law enforcement officer agency to equip police officers with body worn cameras, said Lacey. Langston also coordinated thedevelopment of the South East Regional Mental Health Evaluation team to provide services to those in need by pairing police officers with mental health workers, according to Lacey.</p>
<p>Melissa Guy, the President of the Signal Hill Chamber of Commerce, also presented at Langston’s retirement party with her husband, Marcus Guy, the First Vice President of the Signal Hill Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Melissa Guy shared her first experience with Langston and the SHPD. Nearly 5 years ago, Melissa and Marcus Guy decided to move their business from Hollywood to “the Hill.”</p>
<p>“Moving into the city was pretty easy but getting a grand opening off the ground was not,” Melissa Guy said.</p>
<p>Melissa Guy recounted how she struggled, “(ran) around like a chicken with it’s head cut off” to put the grand opening of her business together. A quarter before 5 pm, when her guests were due to arrive, Chief Langston and his police officers walked through the door.</p>
<p>“I thought we were in big trouble. But instead, Chief Langston smiles and said, ‘Looks like you guys could use some help. We can lend a hand,’” Melissa Guy said.</p>
<p>The very first impression Melissa and Marcus Guy had of moving into Signal Hill as “rookie business owners” was Chief Langston and the SHPD officers helping them set up for the grand opening.</p>
<p>“That single moment has impacted our life here as business owners and as community leaders,” Melissa Guy said, “It has led to us wanting to further support this city and this community.”</p>
<p>AUHS congratulates Chief Michael Langston on his retirement and thanks him for his services to the community. Chief Langston will be greatly missed and we wish him the best in this next season of his life and in all of his future endeavors.</p>

<div class=""mceTemp"">
<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson and his wife Dr. Kim Dang-Johnson (Hon.) , co-founders of AUHS, stood beside one another as they prayed for their employees.</p>
<p>“We have gathered here today to celebrate the birth of our savior [and] the birth of this university. No birth is complete until everybody that should be in the delivery room is there,” said Pastor Johnson, “I thank you for joining us in the delivery room, that you’ve stood with us and watched over all of us. We are newborns that come from the womb; this university. I know how blessed my wife and I are to have you in our lives and I know how blessed our students are that you are in their lives as well.”</p>
<p>AUHS organizes a Christmas party every year for employees to celebrate together, as fellow believers. The conference room came alive with nutcrackers, poinsettias and bowls of candy on the tables. There was a Christmas tree adorned with white lights, red ornaments and a gold star on top. Employees were served with a variety of food and desserts. Christmas songs such as “Feliz Navidad” by, Jose Feliciano and “Rockin Around the Christmas Tree,” by Brenda Lee played in the background while they ate, conversed and made merry.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-image-5517 size-medium alignright"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Holiday-Lunch-Party-2016-no-1-300x257.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""257"">AUHS employees also had the opportunity to play games and win prizes such as chocolates and gift cards. In one of the activities, Dr. Scherlin, the Provost, read a list of quotes from popular films. The guests then had to write down the names of the matching movie titles on a piece of paper. The person who had the most film titles correct won a prize.</p>
<p>“All of the other games on the internet were less challenging,” Dr. Scherlin said as she smiled, “I wanted to challenge all of the great intellectual minds of the university.”</p>
<p>This early Christmas celebration would not be possible without the help and sup</p>
<p>port of AUHS staff and faculty such as Dr. Scherlin who brought the majority of the food for the luncheon, Stephanie Lien (Librarian) who brought cake, Sherry Zhang (Administration Assistant) who brought dumplings, Maria Maloles (Director of Marketing and Publications) who decorated the room, and Dr. Dang-Johnson and Dr. Popoola (Dean of School of Nursing) who donated many prizes.</p>

And he said, “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name, welcomes me.”</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) gave an early Christmas to hundreds of low income families by giving each child a free toy at the “7th Annual Santa Cause Toys for Joy” event on Monday, December 12th, 2016. Participating families also had the opportunity to take a free picture with Santa Claus and were provided with free snacks.</p>
<p>The University parking lot came alive with Christmas wreaths, sparkling ornaments, nutcrackers, and a Christmas tree adorned with red poinsettias and a golden star. There was a display for the Santa Claus photo opportunity, a “Santa’s Workshop” booth where boxes of toys were displayed and a booth with rows of bags filled with snacks. Cheerful Christmas songs such as “We Wish You a Merry Christmas,” “Joy to the World,” and “O Little Town of Bethlehem” played on a loudspeaker while people gathered outside the gates.</p>
<p>The event was scheduled to begin at 2 pm but a line had already begun to form as early as 8 in the morning. The line wrapped around the campus parking lot and was filled with children excited to meet Santa and receive their gifts.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-5596"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/santa-cause-toys-for-joy-event-2-300x200.jpg"" alt=""santa-cause-toys-for-joy-event-2"" width=""300"" height=""200"">Over 40 AUHS nursing students volunteered at the event. The students were dressed in their blue uniforms but showed their holiday spirit by wearing elf ears, reindeer horns and Santa Claus hats. AUHS students, faculty and staff worked as early as 7 am setting up the booths, the</p>
<p>Christmas tree and decorations. They also prepared the toys and packed snacks.</p>
<p>Santa Claus arrived on campus around 2 pm to greet the children who were waiting for him in line. Many of the children ran to Santa for a hug while their parents took pictures on their phones. The attendees of the event was a diverse crowd. Not only were there English speaking families but many Spanish, Cambodian and Filipino speaking families as well. Santa was able to speak several phrases like “Merry Christmas,” “What do you want for Christmas?” and “Have you been good this year?” in Spanish, Tagalog and Khmer to better accommodate the children and their parents.</p>
<p>Quione Rodriguez, AUHS nursing student, became Santa’s little body guard for this year’s event. He stood out amongst his fellow elves by dressing as a modern elf with blue ray-ban sun glasses and a colorful sweater with “Fruit Cake” written across the chest. Rodriguez accompanied Santa while he walked to the line to greet the attendees before the event began, helping families take pictures of Santa.</p>
<p>“It was my first time participating in Santa Cause. I felt very privileged because I was able to interact with the families more than the other students were able to,” Rodriguez said, “This (event) stuck in my head because that’s what being a healthcare professional is all about. Caring for people doesn’t stop when you ‘clock out.’ It becomes a lifestyle and people will always expect you to help.”</p>
<p>Amarri Sanders, AUHS Student Success Coordinator, also volunteered at the event by helping guide the families towards the toy booth.</p>
<p>“The best part was seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces and to see how happy all the mothers were to know that their children will be getting a present for Christmas,” Sanders said, “I love how often the university does charitable events like this and how [all the staff and faculty] gets to be a part of it.”</p>
<p>Sanders donated a baby doll for the Santa Cause event and was able to see the little girl who received her gift.</p>
<p>“It was heart-warming and it felt like I did something meaningful for Christmas,” Sanders said.</p>

<p><strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> <em>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</em></p>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) clinical instructor, Kristen Soegeng was among the firefighters, policemen and other professionals that attended Career Day at California Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMS) high school. Soegeng presented at CAMS Career Day on November 18th to educate and inspire youth who wanted to start career paths as registered nurses after graduation.</p>
<p>Soegeng arrived at CAMS high school fully dressed in sneakers and purple nursing scrubs. She began her presentation by asking the students if they watched medical dramas such as Grey’s Anatomy, The Nightshift, or Nurse Jackie. As the class whispered to one another about&nbsp; their favorite hospital shows, Soegeng told the students that as a nurse she could not enjoy watching them. “I’m too busy paying attention to all the little details in the background that I can’t even focus on the main plot,” Soegeng said, “ I say, ‘That IV doesn’t look right’ or ‘That is so unrealistic’ and ‘That patient would never look like that.’ But I’m glad you guys can enjoy it though!”<br>
Soegeng then went on to say how the Bachelor’s degree in nursing has been voted the most difficult Bachelor’s degree. The reason for this is because of the clinicals nursing students are required to take, according to Soegeng.</p>
<p>“You’re sitting down in a classroom and you’re learning a lot of theory work. But when they take you to clinicals, they expect you to apply what you learn directly on patients who are sick and dying,” Soegeng said, “You go through a lot of real life scenarios at a very young age. ”</p>
<p>Although the path to becoming a registered nurse is difficult, Soegeng told the students to not be discouraged.</p>
<p>“You have a calling in your life,” Soegeng said, “But if you have a passion you have to go after it.”</p>
<p>Soegeng told the class that she wanted to become a nurse when she was in the 10th grade. She was raised by a single mother and oftentimes had to help take care of her grandparents and little brother. Her upbringing helped her build her “innate nature” to “care for other people.”</p>
<p>Soegeng explained some of the major responsibilities of nurses which is to develop, carry out and evaluate the care of patients.</p>
<p>“We work very closely with doctors to figure out what the patient needs, what is the patient’s condition, what do they have, and how we can treat them,” Soegeng said, “We help the doctor develop a plan of care and we are responsible for carrying out the orders.”</p>
<p>She also told the students that nurses are not restricted to working in hospitals. There is a wide range of career opportunities for nurses including nurse attorneys who are expert medical witnesses, politicians who write health policies, and public health nurses who tracks pandemics. There are even nurses for NFL football teams, TV networks and Disneyland.</p>
<p>After discussing the nature of working as a registered nurse, Soegeng explained the role of a clinical instructor. Soegeng currently works as a clinical nurse educator for a Lakewood Regional Medical Center and a clinical instructor for American University of Health Sciences (AUHS).</p>
<p>“You may think that Nurses go to college and they don’t need to learn anything else for the rest of their lives. But healthcare is always changing,” Soegeng said.</p>
<p>The medical field is constantly changing due to research and the development of new medicine and technology. Nurses must be flexible in order to learn and apply these new procedures to their patients.</p>
<p>“It’s my job (as a clinical educator) to bring the changes to the bedside nurses. I have to explain to them why and how we’re doing things differently,” Soegeng said, “I also teach in a nursing school. I take nursing students from the school and teach them in the hospital.”</p>
<p>Soegeng visit on Career Day was a nostalgic one because she attended CAMS high school from 2004-2008. She brought her high school i.d. and passed it around the classroom during her presentation. Her former AP World History teacher, Gene Patrick Almeida, was also present during her speech.</p>
<p>“She’s a dynamic speaker. Very educational and entertaining,” said Almeida, “Her personality captures people’s attention and she’s relatable to the students here.”</p>
<p>Soegeng attended UCLA School of Nursing in 2008 and graduated in 2012 with her Bachelor’s degree in nursing. From 2012-2014 she worked at Los Alamitos Medical Center as a telemetry staff RN. She began her career as a clinical instructor at AUHS in 2014.</p>
<p>“(AUHS) being a Christian university is the main perk,” Soegeng said, “I’ve been through a lot of rough times early in life and there’s a bible verse that says, ‘I can do all things through God who strengthens me.’ Being a nurse is what God wants me to do.”</p>
<p>AUHS is proud to have Soegeng as one of their most successful clinical instructors and wishes her the best in her pursuit to obtain her Doctorate degree. Soegeng plans to attend California State University Fullerton’s School of Nursing in August 2017 to study&nbsp;&nbsp; for her Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree. She will conduct communication research for her DNP in order to help “transform nursing on a higher level.”</p>

 AUHS Gives an Early Thanksgiving Meal to the Homeless,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-gives-early-thanksgiving-meal-homeless/,,University News,"<div class=""mceTemp"">

<p><strong>Isaiah 58:10</strong> <em>And if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light rise in obscurity, and your darkness be as the noonday.</em></p>
<p>American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) gave the homeless an early Thanksgiving meal in their annual Acts of Love: Feeding the Homeless event at the Second Samoan Congregational Church last Sunday morning, November 20th, 2016. The event began at 8 am with a sermon. People of all races, ethnicities, ages, and different walks of life filled the pews and were brought together as one in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The church service was lead by Pastor Gregory Johnson, the co-founder of AUHS. When Pastor Johnson stepped behind the podium, he sang with the choir “Tell Him what you want (Jesus is on the mainline)” by the Staple Singers. The churchgoers rose to their feet, clapped and sang along.</p>
<p>“If you stand up for God, God will stand up for you,” Pastor Johnson told the congregation, “If you don’t stand up for God then you will fall for anything.”</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson told parishioners that “sometimes you just want to be in a place where you can be” but there is nothing greater in this world than to receive God’s blessing.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson reminded the congregation to thank God for being patient with them because there are times when people can lose sight of the blessings that they have.</p>
<p>“I was thinking the other day how ungrateful I can be. And as I thought about that, I realized everything that God has done for me. And if you are ungrateful, it puts you in a place outside of God’s blessing,” Pastor Johnson said, “And one of the most important things that I have come to understand is that if I’m going to say how much I love God, I need to thank God. All you’ve got to do is pray and praise the Lord and God will make it fruitful for you.”</p>

<p>During Pastor Johnson’s service, AUHS nursing students were hard at work in the church’s parking lot. 60 students volunteered for the Feed the Homeless event. They helped pitch the tents, set the chairs and tables, greeted attendees, served food and water, and collected trash.</p>
<p>“We’re always happy to help the people in need,” said Katherine Perez-Tobar, an AUHS nursing student, “It’s very satisfying to see that we’re helping people that actually need help in the community. Volunteering at events likes this gives us the notion and the knowledge of the type people that we’ll be helping out as future nurses.”</p>
<p>AUHS served mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, turkey slices, fried chicken, bread rolls, pumpkin pie, turon (sweet banana egg rolls), pancit (Filipino noodles with meat and vegetables), and more. They also gave away sleeping bags.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people lined up outside the church; the line wrapping around the building. Among the attendees was Coco Logan, a former homeless woman of over 8 years. She said she appreciated Pastor Johnson and AUHS’ efforts in helping those in need.</p>
<p>“(Homeless people) don’t have money or cooking facilities and for a lot of us, this is the only way we get a hot meal,” said Logan, “I appreciate (the AUHS students) coming in and doing this because it’s hard. A lot of people look down on homeless people. They say we stink and we’re dirty. What they are doing is a blessing.”</p>

<p>Not only did AUHS serve the homeless that day but needy, low income families as well. Gasper Lucas and his wife Veronica brought their three children Orlando (age 10), Kelly (age 8) and Nova (age 3) to the event. Gaspar works for a distributing company full-time and his wife Veronica works at a tape agency part-time. However, The Lucas family currently lives in their car and sometimes in motels.</p>
<p>“The 5 dollar (donation), breakfast and every little help that we get goes a long way,” said Gasper, “We appreciate events like this.”</p>
<p>It’s obvious by looking at today’s wonderful event that GIVING is being THANKFUL. AUHS is a private, for-profit, minority owned, minority serving, Christian-based university that offers a B.S. degree in Nursing and Pharmaceutical Sciences and a Master’s degree in Clinical Research.</p>

 AUHS Acts of Love 2016,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-acts-love-2016/,,University News,"<div id=""attachment_5470"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5470"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5470"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ActsofLove2016no1-300x214.jpg"" alt=""AUHS nursing students preparing boxes of stuffing to give to families in need at their annual Acts of Love."" width=""300"" height=""214""><p id=""caption-attachment-5470"" class=""wp-caption-text"">AUHS nursing students preparing boxes of stuffing to give to families in need at their annual Acts of Love.</p></div>
<p><strong>Acts 20:35 – </strong><em>In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”</em></p>
<p>More than 600 people gathered at the gates of American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) the day before Thanksgiving carrying reusable shopping bags, cardboard boxes, backpacks, utility carts, empty strollers, and wagons. AUHS held it’s annual Acts of Love event where they donated free turkeys and groceries to people in need last Wednesday November 23rd, 2016.</p>
<p>The Acts of Love event officially began at 1 pm but a line had already begun to form as early as 6 in the morning. People came in droves- mostly families and senior citizens. The line wrapped around the campus and stretched down several blocks.</p>
<p>Many children played tag and rode their scooters in the parking lot while their parents waited in line. There were elderly people who brought their walkers, wheelchairs and canes. Some brought folding chairs and umbrellas, others left their carts and bags to hold their place in line while they rested under the trees nearby.</p>
<p>AUHS gave 1,000 vouchers to schools and charitable organizations such as Signal Hill Elementary School, Whittier Elementary School, Bobbie Smith Elementary Community School, The United Cambodian Community, and the Lutheran Social Services of Southern California. Approximately 600 people attended the event. AUHS gave 4,000 pounds of turkey, 4,000 pounds of potatoes, 4,000 pounds of yams, 2,000 pounds of carrots, 4,000 pounds of rice, and 150 boxes of stuffing mix.</p>
<p>“I think it’s great they’re giving back to the community and helping the community out,” said Debra Brown who came the event with her 10-year-old daughter, Treasure.</p>
<p>Brown called the AUHS nursing students who volunteered at the event, “wonderful,” and that she appreciated how they made the extra effort to make the attendee’s wait as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>40 AUHS students volunteered at the event fully dressed in their blue nursing uniforms. Some students arrived as early as 6 am to help unload supplies from the food truck, unbox and bag groceries, pitch the tents, set up the chairs and tables, and make other arrangements for the attendees.</p>
<p>As AUHS students and faculty rushed to have the groceries prepared, there were students who stood by the crowd and tended to their needs. Two elderly women approached nursing student Grace Pak for a bottle of water. One of the women told her that her friend was diabetic and beginning to get dehydrated. Pak told the women to wait while she went to ask for them. In the end, Pak made sure the woman received water.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize what I took for granted meant so much to others,” said Pak, “I never knew that this many people were hungry and it feels really good to be part of a school that gives to people in need.”</p>
<p>This was Pak’s first time volunteering at AUHS’ Acts of Love event and she was impressed by the diversity of the crowd.</p>
<p>“It’s a very loving and happy crowd. There’s so many different types of people here,” Pak said, “It helps me open my eyes to the people I’m going to be seeing in a hospital setting in the future.”</p>

<p>Pastor Gregory Johnson and Dr. Kim Dang-Johnson (Hon.), co-founders of AUHS, worked alongside their students in preparing and distributing food to needy individuals. Dr. Dang-Johnson was on the grounds at 6:30 am making sure the food and supplies arrived on time. Pastor Johnson worked diligently at the back of a u-haul truck unboxing and bagging the turkeys.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson and Dr. Dang-Johnson’s children Gregory Jr., Alex, and Temujin also attended the event, helping pass out the groceries. Dr. Dang-Johnson’s sister, Lieu Dang Sus, and her children Matthew and Maddi also volunteered at Acts of Love.</p>
<p>“Whatever we deem to do, what good is there if it fails in blessing true?” Pastor Johnson said, “Or render honor too, ‘THE ONE’ who died for you, and me?”</p>

 Christ Strengthens Me,https://news.auhs.edu/christ-strengthens-me/,,Noonday Prayer,"<p>The halls of American University of Health Sciences were filled with love, song and praise as faculty and staff gathered in the university chapel for their weekly noon prayer last Wednesday, November 16th, 2016. AUHS co-workers came together in the the name of Jesus Christ, held hands and sang “I’ve got the joy” and “This is the day.” Wednesday Noon Day Prayer is a time for AUHS associates to worship God and to support and pray for their Christian brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Attendees sat in a circle and were given a list of passages from both the Old and New Testament of the Bible. They took turns to read each passage out loud and shared what the excerpt meant to them on a personal, professional and spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 41:10</strong> Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous hand.</p>
<p>“Even when you are dealing with the feeling of loss, God will always be with you,” said Pastor Gregory Johnson, the co-founder of AUHS, “The mistake that most people make is that they fail to realize that God may allow terrible things to happen in order to help us grow as individuals. Extreme hardship forces growth.”</p>
<p>People get in their own way sometimes because they let go of their faith. Whether it is with school, work, family, or friends, there are times in life when people feel overwhelmed or have had enough.</p>
<p>“God never puts on you that he knows you can’t bear,” said Pastor Johnson, “God allows you to go through trials and tribulations because He knows that you can get through it.”</p>
<p><strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</p>
<p>All that we have and all that we are is because of God’s blessing.</p>
<p>“Whether you know it or not, God chose you even before you choose God,” Pastor Johnson looked around the room and said, “God orchestrated this. Indeed, He is the one that brought us together.”</p>
<p>But there are voices that may cause you to doubt yourself and others around you, causing chaos, confusion and disunity.</p>
<p>“We have to be careful of two things. The voice of others who don’t share the same dream and the voice in ourselves that may not believe enough in our own dream,” said Pastor Johnson, “Remember that God knows what He’s doing.”</p>
<p>There are times when we lose confidence in ourselves. There are tasks that seem impossible to do and you find yourself unsure of the potential in you. Be strengthened by God and see that you have potential. Believe in yourself because God believes in you.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 18:32-34</strong> the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless. He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights. He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</p>
<p>In times of sorrow and adversity, remember to seek strength and comfort through Christ. If you open your heart to God, you are never alone. He is with you, always.</p>
<p>“We’re only human. Sometimes we get overwhelmed but you need to take a breathe and go to God first. The more we go to Him, the stronger we become,” said Cynthia Chambers, AUHS Financial Aid advisor.</p>
<p>Even moments of extreme hardships can be a blessing in disguise. These extremes exercise the tools intended to increase our faith.</p>
<p>“I don’t think our God is a denying God,” said Pastor Johnson. “‘God’s promise us ‘Yes’ and ‘Amen.’ He wants you to seek Him and He wants you to know that He is the giver and supplier of all things.”</p>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 10:13</strong> No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</p>
<p>God does not put us into a situation where we cannot resist or run away from temptation. God has given each of us free will so we can choose to do good or to do evil.</p>
<p>“The things we go through are things that all people go through. It’s all been done under the sun,” said Kim Dang-Johnson, the co-founder of AUHS, “Temptation is our ‘Achilles heel.’ We are not tempted by the things that we don’t have a problem with but by those decisions struggle with. You may be able to drink (alcohol) all day and will still be able to walk away from it. But some people just can’t put the bottle down.”</p>
<p>People should always believe in their abilities as much as they believe in God. It is important to be wary of evil and always look to God for guidance and protection.</p>
<p>“The devil only comes to steal your confidence in yourself and your ability. Don’t cast away your confidence,” said Kim Dang-Johnson, “Evil uses people, situations and circumstances to derail you. If you give up, the rewards waiting for you will not come to pass.”</p>
<p>You receive what you give in this life. Be strong and courageous in your walk and God will hear you and help you bear that cross.</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 22:1-3</strong> After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.” He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.</p>
<p>“Abraham was willing to give up his only son for God. Blind faith is not easy because we are human. We doubt, we question our faith, but our blind faith will be rewarded,” said Chantal Jura, the Director of Affiliation and Career Services, “God stopped Abraham before he could kill his son. God rewarded him with many more children. Trust in God.”</p>
<p>It would be very understandable and very human reaction for Abraham to defy God’s command in order to save the most precious thing he had in the world, his son.</p>
<p>“The temptation is to ignore God,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>But God’s will is bigger than what we can do in the natural world. Though this task was more than what most fathers could bare, Abraham trusted God’s will and in the end, was rewarded.</p>

 Morning Dew,https://news.auhs.edu/we-cant-always-block-out-the-chatter/,,Morning Dew,"<p>Led by Dr. Mok Chong, Dean of the School of Pharmacy.</p>
<p><em>We can never block out all the chatter – the lies in our minds that are coming from the enemy or from ourselves. But we can learn to tune into God’s voice instead.</em></p>
<p>“We can’t always block out the chatter,” said Ivy Javaluyas, Director of Student Affairs. “We need to start within ourselves. Don’t do unto others that you don’t want done unto you. Javaluyas encouraged her associates to “listen and accept facts” and to use constructive criticism to improve themselves. She disapproved of gossip, stating that it will not resolve the issue. The key to conflict resolution is communication. “Deal with (the problem) positively and talk to the person you have an issue with,” Javaluyas said.</p>
<p>“The devil comes to take away your confidence,” Dr. Chong said, referring to what was mentioned in last week’s Wednesday Noon Day Prayer. The voices that cause self-doubt may come from those close to us, like friends, family and co-workers. The voices of insecurity could also come from within us and tell us you don’t have enough money, experience, etc. “Until you hear the voice of God, you won’t follow the right path,” Dr. Chong said.</p>
<p>“I would tell people my dreams, they say it doesn’t work for me,” said Amari Sanders, Student Success Coordinator. Sanders affirmed that just because something happened to one person does not mean the same thing will happen to everyone else. It all depends on the situation and the circumstances. It’s important to believe and trust in God’s will and to go where God calls you. “My destiny is already written for me,” Sanders said.</p>
<p><strong>2 Corinthians 10:3-5</strong> <em>For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world do. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God. And we take captive every thought to make it obedient.</em></p>
<p>“Sometimes in business, we have confrontations. Be careful not to use weapons of the world,” said Debbie Brooks, financial aid consultant. When she thinks of the phrase, “weapons of the world,” she doesn’t think of literal weapons such as guns but sees weapons as words. “Worldly people may manipulate you, speak poorly of you and lash out to protect themselves,” Brooks said, “This passage says the way to deal with it is through love. God is love. There’s a lot of power to being obedient to His word.”</p>
<p>“God’s word and wisdom is like a shield- it protects us from chatter,” said Dina Hsu, Head Advisor of Admissions. “We don’t know if the words spoken to us is manipulation. The only way to keep peace of mind is to do what we intend to do here and focus on the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>“We are human and we all make mistakes,” Dr. Chong said, “But we do the best we can to overcome every situation with love, patience, kindness.”</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 4: 1-11 </strong><em>If God is for us, who can be against us? In all things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry. The temper came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” And said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down.” And said, “All this I give you, if you bow down and worship me.”</em></p>
<p>“The devil tempts us with materialism”, said Dr. Chong. Some people are so tempted with worldly temptations and desires that we are “unable to live a balanced life,” he said.Chong also stated how people tend to focus on themselves encouraged the group to be considerate of others. People go through hard times but we don’t always know exactly what a person is going through.</p>
<p>“The devil will always tempt up with easy things in life. Stay on the path and don’t let temptations overpower us,” said Chantal Jura, Director of Affiliation and Career Services.</p>
<p>Jura shared a story of how she was walking out of a store when two homeless men asked her for change. She gave them change, spoke with them and learned that the homeless men were veterans. One was an alcoholic who has not seen his son in fifteen years and the other was in the Navy who always wanted to go to medical school. Jura told him about the college grants and programs that were available to veterans and gave him her card. She discovered that the men were asking for money to pay their bus fare so that they could go to church and receive a hot meal. She took them to church and told them, “Whatever you do, please pay it forward.”</p>
<p>“They said, ‘You’re an angel.’ But I’m not. I’m a normal human being,” Jura said, “Always be nice to others. Do unto others that you want don’t unto you.”</p>

<p><strong>1 Timothy 4:8</strong> <em>For bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.</em></p>
<p>American University of Health Sciences hosted 100 prospective nursing students and their friends, family and loved ones who gathered at the BSN Open House last Saturday from 8 am-12 pm for an in-depth orientation about the School of Nursing (SON) program and to meet with the co-founder of AUHS. Prospects were shown how AUHS was unique from most nursing schools because it is a university that is inspired by Christian values and prepares students from diverse backgrounds to serve communities that are medically underserved. AUHS is a place that produces quality health care professionals whose ultimate goal is to preserve and nurture life.</p>
<p>Prospective students had the opportunity to listen to a presentation from Pastor Gregory Johnson, the co-founder of AUHS. Pastor Johnson discussed the mission, core values and community outreach events that are offered by the university. He talked about how it is AUHS’ mission to prepare its students to be culturally competent nurses and how the university not only calls for students to excel in academia, but to leave the university with a deeper appreciation for life. He emphasized how imperative it is for AUHS students to include God and Christian values into their medical services and code of ethics.</p>
<p>“Everything that we have and everything that we could possibly be is based on the grace of God,” said Pastor Johnson.</p>
<p>He began his presentation explaining to the prospective students how he and his wife, Kim Dang-Johnson, started AUHS in 1994.</p>
<p>“When my wife and I started this university, we didn’t start with money. We actually started with prayer and with fasting,” Pastor Johnson said, “We didn’t have money in the bank,<br>
we didn’t borrow money, we didn’t go to investors. We slept on the floor of our office the first year.”</p>

<p>Pastor Johnson told prospects that nothing is impossible through the will of God and encouraged them to persevere even in the most difficult situations. “It’s not really about us, it’s about God. If you allow yourself to see yourself doing great things not just for yourself, but for God and other people, you will have more power and you will know more success,” Pastor Johnson said.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson also announced how AUHS plans to include new curriculums in the near future. The university is planning on including a Masters in Health Sciences by the spring of 2017, an RN to BSN program and a Master of Science in Nursing program by the summer of 2017, a Doctor of Nursing Practice program by the fall of 2017, and a Pharm D program by 2018.</p>
<p>First time visitors also had the opportunity to meet with admissions advisors to discuss the SON admission requirements and program structure. Prospective students were told the length of the program, ideal start dates, course structure and schedule, tuition estimates, and informal career assessments.</p>
<p>Prospects were also able to meet with Mercy Popoola, the Dean for the School of Nursing. Popoola discussed the nature of the SON program and what the university expected from their new students. Popoola was impressed by the large turnout from the open house and called the prospects “very receptive” during her presentation. She hoped that her presentation helped inspire them to begin their nursing careers at AUHS.</p>
<p>Chantal Jura, the Director of Affiliation and Career Services, also presented to prospective students and discussed how her department helped AUHS students find job opportunities after graduation. Jura discussed how AUHS alumni have found careers at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, and much more.</p>

<p>American University of Health Sciences welcomed <a href=""http://www.haitinursing.org/dean-hilda-alcindor/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Dean Hilda Alcindor</a>, the Dean of the <a href=""http://www.haitinursing.org/"" target=""blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">Faculty of Nursing Science of the Episcopal University of Haiti</a> (FSIL) and Joanne Pohl, the President of the Haiti Nursing Foundation Board to its campus on October 10th, 2016.</p>
<p>Alcindor attended A Gala of Support Benefiting the FSIL Nursing School on October 8th at the Renaissance Los Angeles Airport Hotel where she met <a href=""/about-auhs/senior-administration/board-of-trustees/"">Pastor Gregory Johnson</a>, the co-founder of American University of Health Sciences. Pastor Johnson then invited Alcindor to the AUHS campus.</p>
<p>Alcindor and Pohl were first given a tour of the school including a walk through the skills lab. After the tour, AUHS held a luncheon in Alcindor’s honor. During the luncheon traditional Chinese food was served along with a presentation from Pastor Johnson. Pastor Johnson discussed the university’s core values, course description, student life, charity work, and aspirations for the future. He also discussed how AUHS hoped to collaborate with FSIL and the Haiti Nursing Foundation.</p>
<p>“We have to do as much as we can to not pass those in need on the other side,” said Pastor Johnson, “What is happening in Haiti is happening all over the world. We tend to make our giving and our caring trendy. We must stop.”</p>
<p>The terms of the collaboration have not yet been given but this newly found alliance has inspired both AUHS staff and students.</p>
<p>“Anything we can do to support (Alcindor) would be something I would like to get involved with,” said Mercy Popoola, the Dean of AUHS’s School of Nursing.</p>
<p>Popoola had several ideas on how AUHS can provide support to FSIL including a campaign to donate the students white uniforms to FSIL as well as materials from the university skills lab. She also wants to organize a mission trip, bringing AUHS nursing students to Haiti to provide health screenings, nursing care, and health and community education to the country.</p>
<p>Alcindor took the floor after Pastor Johnson’s presentation to discuss FSIL and her experience as a nurse in Haiti. She also recounted&nbsp; the hardships she, her staff and her patients endured in the aftermath of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake killed an estimated 220,000-316,000 people, injured 300,000 and displaced 1.5 million, according to <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/12/world/haiti-earthquake-fast-facts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">CNN</a>.</p>
<p>Alcindor was teaching a psychology class at the FSIL campus when the earthquake struck.</p>
<p>“It lasted less than a minute but it did all the damage that it did,” Alcindor said.</p>
<div id=""attachment_5377"" style=""width: 310px"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><img aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-5377"" loading=""lazy"" class=""size-medium wp-image-5377"" src=""/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/group-photo-2-10-11-16-300x272.jpg"" alt=""“Haiti Nursing Foundation and FSIL comes to AUHS"" width=""300"" height=""272""><p id=""caption-attachment-5377"" class=""wp-caption-text"">(Left to right) Joanne Pohl, Dean Hilda Alcindor, Kim Dang, and Marilyn Uvero.</p></div>
<p>She and the students walked out of the school and 20 minutes after the earthquake, a child came to them looking for help.</p>
<p>“We’re not a hospital. I don’t know why they came. But if you go in (FSIL), they’re going to take care of you,” Alcindor said, “A lot of people came in that night from all walks of life. I was the only nurse there (. . .) working in a war zone.”</p>
<p>Alcindor remembered seeing a 17 year old boy talking to his mother. Moments later, secretion began coming out of his ears and the students asked Alcindor what should they do.</p>
<p>“I said let him die. Do a prayer for him because he’s going to die,” Alcindor said. “We had people come in who had their legs missing. The next day in front of the school we had ten bodies. There was nothing I could do.”</p>
<p>Despite the desperate circumstances and lack of supplies, Alcindor did the best she could to save as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the pharmaceutical people would like me to say this but I learned that expiration dates doesn’t mean much,” Alcindor said.</p>
<p>Alcindor, her students and her staff kept their patients hydrated because they had lost a dangerous amount of blood. They used boxes as splints for broken arms and legs. They also cut bed sheets to use as bandages to dress wounds.</p>
<p>Alcindor’s account of the earthquake was the most compelling to Dianna Scherlin, the Provost and Dean of Nursing of AUHS.</p>
<p>“She demonstrated that the impossible can be achieved. She took what little she had to tirelessly and selflessly provide help to those in need who had nothing left,” Scherlin said.</p>
<p>Scherlin called Alcindor a genuine and remarkable woman, a leader, a humanist, and a role model to AUHS students. Scherlin calls on AUHS students to “use this opportunity to understand humanity at a much deeper level, to learn about disenfranchised people, to work with diverse cultures and to apply Christian values.” Scherlin believes that the collaboration between AUHS, FSIL and the Haiti Nursing and to grow as people, as practitioners, and nurses.</p>

 Health In The Park (HIP) Event – Another Success!,https://news.auhs.edu/health-in-the-park-hip-event-another-success/,,University News,"<p>The Cambodian Health Professionals Association of America (CHPAA), in partnership with the American University of Health Sciences (AUHS), held it’s second Health In the Park (HIP) event on Saturday, August 30<sup>th</sup> at MacArthur Park, in Long Beach, California. The event was free to attend and open to community members of all ages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of HIP is to promote and advance the health and wellness of the Signal Hill and Long Beach communities in alignment with the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), thus making Long Beach a healthier and safer place to live.</p>
<p>HIP offered free health screenings, health education, prevention awareness, wellness promotion, the latest information about treatments and access to health care with enrollment in health insurance and other programs, referrals to community resources including yoga and meditation, and most importantly, in-person health chats with doctors and other health professionals. There was also entertainment for the children in attendance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIP aims to target the disadvantaged populations — including a large Cambodian-American population. It is widely recognized that the Cambodian-American population has suffered a disproportionately high rate of myriad diseases like Hepatitis B and C, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and mental illness — notably PTSD, a consequence of the traumatic experiences associated with the Khmer Rouge genocide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIP stands apart from the conventional Health Fair format because it is a bimonthly recurring event, to be held the last Saturday of every other month. The leadership provided by AUHS and CHPAA is also significant, as the organization is comprised of physicians and other health professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was a success with many people coming out to have free health screenings, obtain health education and have some fun!</p>

 Health Care Seeking Behavior in Rural Chiapas,https://news.auhs.edu/health-care-seeking-behavior-in-rural-chiapas/,,University News,"<p>On Thursday, August 28<sup>th</sup>, the American University of Health Sciences current students, prospective students and faculty all attended an informative presentation from guest speaker Sonja Ulrich discussing her work in Ciapas, Mexico.</p>
<p>Professor Ulrich studied the health care system in Southern Mexico looking into whether the local population used biomedical science or a more traditional method of healing. During her research she had found that there were multiple clinics and hospitals available, however those living within the Ciapas area preferred to use homeopathic remedies. The reason behind this was the lack of a proper infrastructure needed to support a functioning biomedical practice.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there were clinics and hospitals, there were a lack of doctors, nurses and medical equipment which made it almost impossible for patients to be seen in a timely manner – it at all. Basic necessities that we may take for granted in some areas are also not readily available in Ciapas, Mexico. Professor Ulrich found that poverty was a large road block in relation to health. Access to water, clean housing and low income were all conductive to poor health. If one was lucky enough to even have access to water, where they cooked their food, for example indoors or outdoors played a major role in their health.</p>
<p>As a result of this, locals relied upon traditional healers for medical attention unless their medical issues needed immediate attention and were an emergency. Using rattlesnake skins and local plants, they found ways to heal snake and spider bites, stomach aches, minor aches and bone pain.</p>
<p>As the men were out working in the fields, the women tended to take care of the medical issues and family healthcare at home. Their first attempt would generally be to try and heal themselves and if that did not work, they would go to a traditional healer and if they still had no luck, their last resort was going to an actual clinic or hospital.</p>
<p>The presentation by Professor Sonja Ulrich was enlightening, bringing our attention to things that we normally take for granted. AUHS thanks Professor Sonja Ulrich for sharing her findings with us and Professor Brandon Fryman of AUHS for facilitating.</p>

 ACRP-Southern California Chapter,https://news.auhs.edu/acrp-southern-california-chapter/,,University News,"<div>The Southern California Chapter of the Association of Clinical Research Professional met for a meeting on Wednesday, July 30th where they heard a very informative presentation by Michael R. Hamrell, Ph. D. of Moriah Consultants on the Ethical Considerations in Clinical Research.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Dr. Michael R. Hamrell, RAC is the President of MORIAH Consultants, a Regulatory Affairs and Clinical Research consulting firm located near Los Angeles, CA. Dr. Hamrell has a unique background with over 25 years’ experience in regulatory affairs, clinical research and drug development with academia, the FDA, NIH and in industry. He also worked for over 5 years at the FDA and 3 years at the NIH in the Division of AIDS, coordinating the development of drugs, biologics and vaccine products for AIDS, oncology and anti-infectives. Dr. Hamrell has dealt with Regulatory Authorities in over 40 countries and supervised all aspects of product development and approval.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Dr. Hamrell spent a number of years doing basic research, first as a Research Fellow at Duke University and later as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology at the McGill University Cancer Center. He has a Ph.D. degree in Pharmacology from the University of Southern California and a B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Hamrell has received numerous awards for his research, teaching and professional work and is recognized in Who’s Who. He has published numerous papers in pharmacology, regulatory affairs, product development, clinical research, computers and information systems.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Dr. Hamrell also serves on the Editorial Board of Regulatory Affairs FOCUS, Drug Information Journal, and Applied Clinical Trials.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>At Dr. Hamrell’s presentation at ACRP – Southern California Chapter, he talked about the history of clinical trials and how they used to take place not too long ago, from the Nuremberg Code in 1947, through to the Common Rule in 1991.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Declaration of Geneva, the Tuskegee Study, HeLa Cells, as well as other lapses of ethical consideration in clinical research that have taken place over time were discussed. Although great medical discoveries were made during these times, they were not made in the correct way. Dr. Hamrell went on to discuss the advancements the industry has made since then and how there has been more regulation put in place today.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>There have been many positive aspects that have come out of clinical research that allow us to make medical advances with vaccinations, medicines, cures, as well as in many other areas within the medical field, however, at the same time, there is a delicate balance of at what cost. The general public remains weary of medical research and clinical trials but with more regulation and transparency, there is hope that this can be turned around, and more medical breakthroughs can be made. Dr. Hamrell makes once final point and that is to always remember that every single individual in these trials is someone’s family – a mother, father, sister or brother and if we always view them in this way, we are closer to having the correct balance in clinical trials.</div>

 AUHS at COMIC-CON 2014,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-at-comic-con-2014/,,University News,"<p>Crowds moved around in tight knit spaces, all bound by a common desire to experience the magic and the dreams of their own, as well as others. Costumed heroes, villains, aliens abound, all moving up, then down aisles, around booths where voices explained what they saw. This was ComiCon 2014. To be amongst those dressed up as ComicCon characters and experience their energy and passion was infectious for those that attended ComicCon. Over 125,000 people lined up to gain entry into a world of superheroes, comic books, movies, novels, games and illustrations. Everyone at ComiCon set time aside from their day-to-day schedules to step into this world of fantasy.</p>
<p>ComiCon was founded over 44 years ago and since it was first launched approximately 40 years ago in the basement of a hotel, a lot has changed. Back when it was first launched, the concept of such an event was very new and the only thing that it could be compared to was Star Trek. Today, as we know, it is so much more than just comic books that are incorporated into ComiCon.</p>
<p>It has been said that the event keeps getting better every year and 2014 was no exception. At ComiCon, there are no limits as to what someone can do, or wear. Attendees and vendors are able to choose from a large range of material including movies, comic books, novels, video games and anime in order to come up with inspiration for their costumes and booths – and they do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ComiCon is officially labeled as a celebration of the popular arts which was created by a “small city of geeks”, but it is so much more than that. At ComiCon, attendees are able to view exclusive previews and get first looks at new movies, new and returning TV shows, play the latest games, meet artists and stars, get involved in virtual reality, new technology and much more. At a typical day at the ComiCon conference you can see Kevin Bacon signing his name, Wesley Snipes enjoying the moments, Hulk Hogan being the “Hulkster”, Paul Rudd looking towards Marvel’s “Ant-Man”, Julie Newmar, of Batman, Sin City creator Frank Miller at the press line for “Frank Miller’s Sin City: A Dame To Kill For”, Michael Douglas and Samuel L. Jackson gazing at an “Avengers: Age Of Ultron” &nbsp;and &nbsp;Stephen Colbert at the Legendary Pictures preview – and these are just a few of the famous faces that graced ComiCon this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) is passionate about high quality education, faith in God, love of humankind, diversity as well as having fun. This is one of the reasons why they attended the ComiCon Conference in San Diego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AUHS believes in following your dream, and encourages all of its students to work hard to fulfil their goals of becoming nurses within the medical industry. To be part of a conference where zombies crawl, spiders jump and turtles run among infants, toddlers, teens, and adults is definitely a break from the norm, and is symbolic of what AUHS represents – standing out from the crowd and doing what it takes to become exceptional, with God by your side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as attendees from all walks of life take over downtown San Diego filling bars, hotels and restaurants, ComiCon shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>

As Exhibitors arrived on site as early as 08:00 AM at the LA Convention Center and continuing to work through the night well past 09:00 PM in making certain that attendees who have stood in line for hours have the best experience and the most wonderful of times, these next 4 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best of life is granted when we as adults are still able to imagine and to dream. To immerse ourselves in fantasies laden with innocence as we wander to places, down aisles where our childhood once thought common, even in today where mortgages, car notes and careers make an assault on our senses in an effort to waylay a dream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be the stuffed animals, the action figures, the Coplay and the journals written of love and worlds within worlds, that will hold sway the youthful hearts of we who deem tenderness of spirit a virtue. And, it will be men and women who share a common bond, who encourage one another to create, to wait and move steadily forward never doubting they will gain entry into the portals of the fantastic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us cheer loudly. Let us clap boldly. Let us grasp firmly this hour of dreams, in Anime.</p>

 AUHS & the City of Signal Hill,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-city-signal-hill/,,University News,"<p style=""text-align: center;"">Michelle Ericsson</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p><p>The American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) has long been a supporter of the City of Signal Hill, working together in unity to make the community of Signal Hill a great place to live. Building a university is no easy task; however, AUHS is thankful for the continuous support of the City of Signal Hill over the years. With regular community outreach events, AUHS serves over 1000 community members every quarter through their non-profit events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AUHS is a 2014 sponsor of the City of Signal Hill and they recently took part in the City of Signal Hill’s “Spring Fest” event on Saturday, April 19th. During this event, AUHS’s Nursing students were able to educate children and their families on the very basics of health care, showing them how a stethoscope works and giving out some Easter stuffed animal toys. The day was fun-filled with Easter egg hunts, a bounce house, face-painting, giant bunnies and an AUHS humpty dumpty. AUHS also had a raffle going on where the lucky winner had a chance to win a Kindle. The Mayor of Signal Hill, Mayor Ed Wilson came to AUHS to pick the winner at random. The Kindle went to Nancy Torres. A very happy Nancy came to the AUHS campus to collect her Kindle prize which was presented to her by Michelle Ericsson from the Community and Media Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim Dang, Founder of AUHS and Pastor Gregory Johnson, Chief Operating Officer of AUHS believe that it is very important to give back to the community and help others in need. It is for this reason that they had set up the AUHS Foundation. In addition to the foundation, Kim Dang and Pastor Gregory Johnson built into their students graduation requirements, that they must complete a certain number of “Community Hours” in order to graduate. It is during these community hours that the students volunteer for the various community outreach events and programs, and get involved with the Signal Hill Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City of Signal Hill, in turn, has always been a supporter of AUHS, with Mayor Ed Wilson attending the recent AUHS graduation ceremony on Monday, May 12th at the Long Beach Convention Center. This graduation ceremony was particularly important to AUHS as it marked its 20 Year Anniversary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The American University of Health Sciences appreciates the City of Signal Hill and recognizes that a lot of the time, cities are just used to hearing complains – it’s part of the nature of the job, but AUHS is showing their gratitude and hopes to continue to serve the City of Signal Hill and all of its community members, just as God would want and intend them to.</p>

 Artology,https://news.auhs.edu/artology/,,Event Summaries,"<p>On Wednesday, April 2<sup>nd</sup> Art students from the American University of Health Sciences took part in an Art Show showcasing their work. The theme of the show was “Wonderful Woman”. Their Art Instructor, Yuki Toy explained why she chose this theme, “This year’s Artology theme was “Wonderful Woman”.&nbsp;One of the beautiful things about women is the fact that they have wonderful curvy body lines. It shows attractive drawing lines on a paper. Women also have the power of motherhood, sweetness, and strength. It is important to show women’s beauty from both inside and outside.&nbsp;I think that everyone captured what the true beauty is in a woman’s body and life, by using the lines and shadowing techniques that they learned in last 2 quarters. I was very happy to see the great results on the final.”</p>
<p>The art work was judged by three artists within the Los Angeles area; Eric Almanza, an artist and an art teacher at West Adam Preparatory High School in the Los Angeles Unified School District, Timothy Robert Smith, an artist and Art Professor at Cal State Los Angeles who was selected for the “Most Memorable Paintings in 2013 in the Huffington Post, and Peter Zokosky, a professional artist and an Artistic Anatomy professor at California State University, Long Beach.</p>
<p>With classical piano music playing in the background, spectators meandered around the artwork, admiring the different ways that the “Wonderful Woman” theme was portrayed. Some of the art students used the project as an opportunity to draw those in their lives that had had an impact and struck them as “Wonderful Woman”. Others looked to some infamous woman in history such as Princess Diana, Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe. Other art work depicted superheroes such as Wonder Woman, whilst some showcased the modern day woman who does it all – jugging family life, housework and work. The art work showed a great range from historical and traditional figures, all the way through to the modern day woman.</p>
<p>After everyone had a chance to enjoy some light refreshments and view all of the art work, everyone choose their favorites including the judges. Third place went to Robert Bayani with his great drawing skills and key for detail when capturing the human body. Robert successfully used the technique called “smudging” which is a form of blending lead onto the paper. The way he created the juxtaposition of a female and a subway was interesting.</p>
<p>Second place went to Dana Ortega who had the most eye catching image of the entire art show. The female portrait that Dana drew had striking contrast which gave a very strong impression to the viewers. She told a very meaningful story with her art work which provides us with depth and understanding of the purpose of the picture.</p>
<p>The winner of the Artology April 2014 was Johnny Nguyen. Johnny used soft drawing techniques and chose to draw 2 female figures which was very unique. His style was very original. The composition of his drawing also worked out very well in his drawing. He did a great job filling in the negative spaces on a large canvas. The judges all agreed that Johnny should receive first place unanimously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuki Toy, tells us a little bit more about her experience in teaching AUHS students and how her art classes correspond with the rest of their teachings. “I have been teaching basic shading and perspective, anatomical terminology, the movement/function of bones and muscles to students in ART200.&nbsp;Students can utilize the knowledge of anatomy to define shapes and form. ART300 contains advanced concepts of art such as: Modern Art History, portrait drawings and projects with specific themes.”</p>

 Pray It Forward 2014,https://news.auhs.edu/pray-forward/,,Event Summaries,"<p>On Monday, April 7<sup>th</sup>, local community members of Signal Hill were in for a surprise, as over 25 American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) students set out in the surrounding community giving out $5 bills to unsuspecting individuals as a “random act of kindness”. Each $5 bill was accompanied by a card which started “Someone reached out to you with an act of kindness. DON’T PAY IT BACK, PAY IT FORWARD. Do something nice for three people that you don’t know, leave this card behind and ask them to do something nice for three more people”.</p>
<p>Students set out spreading some Monday happiness, giving both themselves, and others – a great start to the week.</p>
<p>P(R)AY It Forward is set to continue as a once a quarter event from the AUHS Foundation.</p>

 Be Not Discouraged,https://news.auhs.edu/be-not-discouraged/,,Morning Dew,"<div><strong><em>“Be not discouraged when trials do come. Be not dismayed at the storm.&nbsp; For where the wind blows, so too the sail, that helps you move along. The storm is but a prelude, for the promises He has made. Soon you will reach the shore that waits, and bask within the glade.”</em></strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OBSTACLES</strong></p>
<p>Each obstacle that you and I face is permitted by our God.</p>
<p>Your Father knows what is to come and makes certain He’s beside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DIFFICULTIES</strong></p>
<p>Through difficulties, we are groomed. We are made fit for the steps to come.</p>
<p>We need our difficulties to expand if we would learn to run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>STUMBLING BLOCKS, STEPPING STONES</strong></p>
<p>Stumbling blocks, they come to us, equipped sometimes with pain.</p>
<p>They rise at times when we felt certain, we’d never fall again.</p>
<p>Stumbling blocks occur and then reveal who stands with we.</p>
<p>Unless the barrier comes, it is hard, at times for us to see.</p>
<p>Stumbling blocks are hard, are big and difficult to lift.</p>
<p>Sometimes we simply have to ask for others to come and give assist</p>
<p>So do not be discouraged, do not feel sad, when stumbling blocks arise.</p>
<p>You need them to be your stepping stones in the success His love inspires.</p>

" The American Red Cross, American University of Health Sciences and a Platinum Award",https://news.auhs.edu/american-red-cross-american-university-health-sciences-auhs-platinum-award/,,University News,"<p>The American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) was honored when they learnt that they had received a <a href=""https://www.redcrossblood.org/info/centralohio/blood-drive-sponsor-recognition-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Platinum Award</a> from the American Red Cross congratulating them on a 71% increase on the amount of blood they had given to the American Red Cross in support of their Community Volunteer Blood Program.</p>
<p>Michelle Ericsson from the Community and Media Department and Lynda Le from the Employer Relations/Career Services Department attended the Awards Ceremony breakfast on Wednesday, April 26<sup>th</sup> where they were joined by 150 other guests from different companies including Kraft, Disney, Cal State Long Beach, and General Electric (GE) who all worked with the American Red Cross to help save lives.</p>
<p>The morning included presentations from Darrin Greenlee, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the American Red Cross, Southern California Region who talked about why he decided to start working with the American Red Cross and how it was a personal mission of his. Both of his parents had needed blood as a result of surgeries from illnesses and if that blood had not been there, they may not have had the chance that they did. Blood is something that we can all give and it can make a life or death difference. &nbsp;Darrin is always thinking of patients that are in vital situations where they are in need of blood and that motivates him every day.</p>
<p>Next we heard from Dr. Joy L. Fridey who discussed the technical aspects of blood and it’s make up. Although science has found ways that blood can be artificially made, we are still quite a ways away from actually being able to use that blood on patients, which increases the need for more blood donors.</p>
<p>Amy Papageorges is AUHS’s American Red Cross account manager and she shared the story of her niece, Nick. Nick had needed blood after a hiking accident and had that blood not been there, Nick might now have been here with us today. For Amy, this really hit home and made all the work that she does even more special.</p>
<p>The American Red Cross awards breakfast was great way for us to see how much giving blood helps those around us. No one ever knows when they themselves or someone close to them might need blood, so while we can, we should try to give as much as possible. AUHS is proud to continue to work with the American Red Cross and support its cause and mission.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Attendees saw a very high caliber of Poster Presentations, each discussing topics that affect different parts of the community, from the elderly population, to those with diabetes, issues affecting children, those affected with obesity and more. Cohort 10 students exemplified their extensive knowledge on their chosen subject, showing that they are one step closer to using all that they learnt at AUHS out in the field to help others when they become nurses.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The audience included Signal Hill Police Chief, Michael Langston, whom continues to show his on-going and unwavering support to the safety and well-being of the Signal Hill community. Pastor Johnson, Founder and C.O.O of AUHS said this about Chief Langston, “Mr. Langston is a unique man that watches over all of us. Him and his officers are blessed by God and do so much good for us every day. It is an honor to have him with us this evening.”</p>

</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">With a harpist playing softly in the background, guests enjoyed light refreshments before the judges made their final decisions as to who the top three Poster Presentation groups were. Although their decision was tough, the winning groups were very deserving.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Professor Cherie Forsha, one of the Professors at AUHS’s School of Nursing, said, “I wanted to congratulate the students of Cohort 10 on their excellent presentations last night. I have chaired the Nursing Practice Conference Oral and Poster Presentations for Los Angeles County for the past 12 years and must say that the degree of professionalism and decorum exhibited last evening was one of high quality. The intricate detail and expressions of passion for community-based health makes me proud that the young men and women of Cohort 10 will soon join the ranks of nursing and some will find interest in some aspect of community and/or public health. Working with vulnerable populations humbles one, because we will all soon join the ranks of some type of vulnerable population. The students seem to understand the influence they can have over their future and not just over those living among the vulnerable populations they had the opportunity to work with.”</p>

 SANTA CAUSE,https://news.auhs.edu/auhs-sop-website-maintenance/,,Event Summaries,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Michelle Ericsson&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p><p>On Friday, December 20th hundreds of under-privileged children, along with their families, lined up outside of the Second Samoan Church to receive toys and get pictures with Santa Clause, followed by a sit-down dinner – all in the spirit of Christmas and giving back to the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As they lined up on the sunny winter day, one week before Christmas, the children and their families were ushered into the church where they listened to a service by Pastor Johnson, followed by a short presentation for the adults on the dangers of self-prescribing medication, by Dr. Mok Chong. As the time to meet Santa drew closer, the children all gasped in excitement as they caught a glimpse of Santa Clause making his way across the stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The event known as “Santa Cause” was put together by the American University of Health Sciences Foundation, partnering with Barrier Free Life who provided the toys for the event, and The Ari and Lieu Suss Family who contributed a large donation. Over 50 AUHS students, staff and faculty were at the event volunteering and making the day one to remember. Bread of Life volunteers provided additional support, as well as some members of the US Army. During the event which consisted of over 300 families, each child received a toy and a chance to “meet and greet” and have photos taken with Santa Clause, his elves and Mrs. Clause!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sit-down dinner gave families a chance to relax and unwind; celebrating Christmas with their loved ones close by and forgetting about any troubles they may be having – if only for a short time. For some families, “Santa Cause” may have been the only Christmas celebration they have this year, and AUHS was more than happy to do what they could to bring them good memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The holidays are a time for children and families and the aim of Santa Cause was exactly that – to focus on children and families, lighting up the eyes of the children and giving them the feeling that all children should have at Christmas – one of hope, excitement and God.</p>

 A Time to Give Thanks,https://news.auhs.edu/time-give-thanks/,,University News,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early hours of the morning on Friday, November 22nd 2013, crowds of Signal Hill and Long Beach in-need community members gathered at The American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) to receive a box of Thanksgiving groceries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AUHS Foundation was hosting it’s Acts of Love: Giving Thanks event. Staff and students were distributing boxes of Thanksgiving groceries, which included a turkey, stuffing, potatoes, rice, vegetables, juice, and pie to approximately 800 families in-need, within the Signal Hill and Long Beach area, so that those families could have a Thanksgiving dinner of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, many weeks of preparation proved to be successful as the AUHS Foundation saw its largest turn out to-date, with thousands gathering at the university gates. This gives a clear indication that there are many who require help within the community, and AUHS continues to do as much as they can to address this growing need through many mediums, including their regular non-profit events. AUHS students, staff, and faculty volunteers are always dedicated to providing assistance, working together to unload groceries, pack boxes and distribute food to the masses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AUHS Foundation partnered with Superior Supermarket, who supplied the groceries, Barrier Free Life, who provided grocery tote bags and volunteered their time, XR LLC, who both donated to the event and volunteered, as well as with Home Depot, who provided some of the boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to picking up their Thanksgiving groceries, community members had the opportunity to have their blood pressure checked by AUHS’s student nurses and receive information on how they can lead a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the AUHS Foundation runs non-profit events throughout the year, Acts of Love: Giving Thanks is especially close to their hearts as Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on all that we have to be thankful for, and in return all that we can do to help others. With just over 800 families’ in-need enjoying a Thanksgiving dinner, it is safe to say that Acts of Love: Giving Thanks was a success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AUHS Foundation look forward to their next event, Santa Cause, taking place on Friday, December 20th at the Second Samoan Congregational Church in Long Beach.</p>

 There are Real Superheroes,https://news.auhs.edu/there-are-real-superheroes/,,University News,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Pastor Johnson</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the midst of all the costumed heroes and pretend fantasies, tonight I experienced what it means to be a hero, every day of our lives. When I say hero, I am not talking about a hero that wears leotards or has X-Ray vision – I am talking about the heroes that make up a family. One family in particular springs to mind. A hard-working family who has made amazing things happen in just three short years, putting together a spectacular event. An event that allows those who still dream, to continue to be dreamers, an event that gives individuals a platform of expression and creativity- in the midst of an often cynical world. And the event that I am speaking of? Comikaze Con.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was leaving the Los Angeles Convention Center, the night before the opening of the event, talented men and women were still hard at work setting up their booths so that audiences of like-minded dreamers can have a place to come and experience a different world. Here in the heart of the bustle of downtown LA, fellow geeks can all gather freely and unite. At Comikaze everyone is liberated of the burden of the everyday life that says “it’s about time you take your life more seriously.” At Comikaze, you are free to dress-up like She-Ra, Jungle Girl or Wonder Woman, without the glaring eyes of those who seem to think that beauty is not one of the gifts that come from God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the preparation for this event, I saw many things. I saw the Carpinelli family who worked hard this whole year, to make this event one of the best Pop Culture events in Los Angeles. I saw Regina and the whole Comikaze team putting all of their energy into ensuring that everyone has a great experience. I saw Corey running around helping everyone, making everyone feel important and special – making it so that we want to come back and do the same each year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This event is filled with all ages, including children. Children spend so much time looking up to these superheroes when, to see a real hero, all they have to do is look in the mirror. It made me think about my own children and how heroic they are. Like my son Gregory, who was standing beside me as I worked long hours to build what God has assigned to me, or my daughter Alexandria who still laughs and smiles at the smallest things as though every day is Christmas. Or my son Temuijn who, even when I was late and missed the parade, was glad to see his dad, and held my hand as we left school for the day. The other heroes in a family are the mothers, like my wife Kim, who, over the years of me being lost, never gave up hope, never stopped praying and never regretted that she married someone who continues to be a dreamer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, just 12 hours before the doors open for this year’s Comikaze event, and the eyes of children both young and old can immerse themselves in a place where art, science and technology all amass together – I remember the real-life heroes that God has sent us.</p>

 Reaching Out To The Homeless Population,https://news.auhs.edu/reaching-out-to-the-homeless-population/,,University News,"<p>Signal Hill, CA – Nursing students and faculty from American University of Health Sciences (AUHS) School of Pharmacy will be offering free health screenings and prescription checks to men, women and families who are in need on Saturday, September 8, from 9:45 a.m. to Noon, at A Church of Love, 2094 Cherry Avenue, Signal Hill, 90755. Called WISH/MASH (Women Inspiring Self Health/Men Achieving Self Health), the event provides the public with access to healthcare students and professionals who will evaluate health issues and needs, review medical histories, check for contra-indications with regard to prescription drugs, and discuss financial and spiritual needs. The event is free and open to the public. AUHS provides food at the end of the event along with a small stipend for transportation.</p>
<p>Faculty, students, and Pastor Johnson will be available for interviews along with some participants.</p>
<p>AUHS has been partnering with A Church of Love to provide these free health screenings to the community since 2010. Pastor Gregory Johnson, head of “A Church of Love” and Co-Founder of AUHS as well as Vice Chairman of AUHS’ Board of Trustee’s, felt there was a need to help those in trouble. “Times are very hard for so many families, as well as those who are currently living out on the streets. I believe in helping those who have no options and giving back to my community. So we created these events where people who have been left out of the system, forced out, or dropped off the grid can come and get the medical attention they need.” Over 50% of WISH/MASH participants are homeless, the rest are low-income working families.</p>
<p>Held every quarter at A Church of Love, WISH/MASH has helped thousands of low income families and the homeless by providing glucose and blood pressure tests, ongoing consultation of medical needs, and spiritual guidance. “Most of the people we see have little or no health insurance,” Pastor Johnson explains. “We see high rates of diabetes and heart disease due to a lack of proper diets and insufficient access to medical attention. Also, so many are self-medicating or taking the incorrect dosage because they do not have regular access to a doctor.” Those who are diagnosed with immediate medical concerns are taken to local City and County facilities that can provide treatment and care.</p>
<p>For Johnson and the staff at AUHS, this is an ongoing service they provide to the community at large. They continually monitor all who participate in WISH/MASH making sure they are taking their medication and staying healthy. Knowing that these events occur regularly provides stability for these individuals in terms of their healthcare.</p>
<p>Pastor Johnson has been working with the homeless for over 10 years. Giving back to the community and helping those less fortunate has always been a top priority for him and Kim Dang, Co-Founder of AUHS. As a Christian-based, minority-serving university, the values of faith in God, love of humankind, and respect for all persons, irrespective of differences are embraced. “The vision and mission of AUHS is found in our faith in God and a strong, dedicated faculty and staff who work diligently to provide our students with outstanding educational opportunities. We believe in a continuum of education that begins when students enter the university and never ends,” states Dr. Dang-Johnson. “AUHS makes a commitment to our students that they will be intellectually prepared to serve their community as a health care professional who have the skills, ability, leadership, and empathy that will meet the changing demands of health care both here and abroad. I am proud to say that our students and alumni reflect the positive human values we believe are essential within the changing health care environment in order to make a significant contribution to society.”</p>

 “Acts of Love” Food Giveaway,https://news.auhs.edu/acts-of-love-food-giveaway/,,Event Summaries,"<p>Signal Hill, CA – American University of Health Sciences, a Christian-based, minority-serving university dedicated to providing high-quality education centered around the precepts of God, the ethics of care and community service, will be hosting an “Acts of Love” Food Giveaway on Friday, September 7, 2012 from 3:00 – 5:00 p.m. on the university campus located at 1600 E. Hill Street in Signal Hill. Nursing and Pre-Pharmaceutical students will be on-hand to provide free health screenings along with brown bag sessions. The event is sponsored by the American University of Health Sciences Foundation and with the support of Superior Markets.</p>
<p>Acts of Love was developed as a way for the school and its students to give back to the community and designed for low-income families and homeless. Pastor Gregory Johnson, Co-Founder of AUHS as well as Vice Chairman of AUHS’ Board of Trustee’s states, “we receive so much from God and have seen so many wonderful things these 18 years as we have grown. To do this and more can never reach the scale of the generosity He renders to us each day.”</p>
<p>Johnson went on to explain that “volunteering for soup kitchens and offering shelter and basic necessities for the homeless and needy are usually reserved for the holidays. But today so many families are in dire need. At AUHS, the passion for assisting those in need is neither seasonal nor temporary. It is something to which we are committed to providing regularly. That is why, through our Acts of Love program, we continually distribute food to needy families in our community all year round. Since we first started Acts of Love in 2010, we have seen the program grow from 150 to 600 boxes of food, enough to feed a family for several days.”</p>
